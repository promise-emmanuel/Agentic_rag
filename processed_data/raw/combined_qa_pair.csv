There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes),']","Preach My Gospel helps missionaries study effectively and prepare to teach by providing chapters that focus on fundamental principles and doctrines. It encourages flexibility in study, allowing missionaries to spend time on specific paragraphs or entire chapters based on their needs. The resource emphasizes the importance of studying scriptures, learning doctrines, and applying principles, which helps missionaries strengthen their own testimony and better teach others. Chapters such as chapter 2, which discusses effective study and preparation, and chapter 3, which addresses doctrines to teach, are designed to enhance missionaries' gospel knowledge and teaching skills. The guide also highlights the importance of following the Spirit, keeping commandments, and applying what is learned to be most effective in their missionary work.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What does 2 Nephi teach about the importance of the Atonement?,"['and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ### Consider This (Page 15) - What is my purpose as a missionary? - What is the gospel? - Why do we preach the gospel? - Why must I teach with power and authority? - What is the message of the Restoration? Why is it so important? - What is my responsibility in helping others become converted? - How will I know whether I am a successful missionary? > Questions to help study this chapter by looking for the answers ## Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 15) You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. All of them are children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (D&C 59:23), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of guilt that come from mistakes and sins. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (2 Nephi 2:6, 8). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, Title Page). As your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great . . . importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (2 Nephi 2:8). President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world. That is the cause that must unite us today. Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167). You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. To come to the Savior they must have faith in Him unto repentance— making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenants of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). ### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11. In this vision, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God (see 1 Nephi 11:21–22). - In the vision, what did the people need to do to be able to partake of the fruit? What do we need to do to receive all the blessings of the Atonement? In what ways do commitments and covenants help us partake of these blessings? - As a missionary, what is your duty in helping others find and partake of the fruits of the gospel? - What did Lehi desire after he had eaten the fruit? (See 1 Nephi 8:10–18.) ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 17) The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for families: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational']","2 Nephi emphasizes that redemption comes through the Holy Messiah, and that no one can dwell in the presence of God except through His merits, mercy, and grace.

Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ## The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power? Study Alma 17:2–3, D&C 53:3, 1 Corinthians 2:4 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 19) Look at the painting of Christ ordaining the Apostles, and then read John 15:1–16. - In what way is Christ the vine? How are you a branch of that vine? How does your setting apart relate to this relationship? - Read again your ministerial certificate. Record your feelings and thoughts about what you read.

What role does the Holy Ghost play in sanctification according to the context?,"['and His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment.

As you study the doctrines in the missionary lessons, you will come to see that we have one message: Through a modern prophet, God has restored knowledge about the plan of salvation, which is centered on Christ’s Atonement and fulfilled by living the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Make sure that everyone you teach clearly understands the following: - God is our literal Father in Heaven. He loves us. Every person on earth is a child of God and a member of God’s family. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior and Redeemer. - Our loving Father in Heaven reached out to His children throughout biblical history by revealing His gospel to prophets. Sadly, many people rejected that gospel; even some of those who accepted it changed gospel doctrines and ordinances and fell into unbelief and apostasy. - Our Father in Heaven sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. He performed miracles and taught His gospel. He accomplished the Atonement and was resurrected. - Beginning with the First Vision, God has again reached out in love to His children. He restored the gospel of Jesus Christ and His priesthood authority and organized His Church on the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence of this Restoration. As you help investigators see the pattern of apostasy and restoration, they will be prepared to understand the great need for the latter-day Restoration. They will see the need to accept the restored gospel, receive the ordinances of salvation by the authority of the restored priesthood, and follow the way to eternal life. Help people recognize that the Church is not just another religion, nor is it an American church. Rather, it is a restoration of the “fulness of [the] gospel” (D&C 1:23), the same as was revealed and taught from the beginning. The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. It is the keystone of our religion, the most powerful resource for teaching this message.']","2 Nephi helps teach that the gospel of Jesus Christ is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. It emphasizes inviting others to come unto Christ through faith, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.

What does the context teach about the nature of God?,"['Some important truths restored through Joseph Smith include the knowledge that God is our Father and that we are His spirit children, that we lived with Him before birth, and that families can live together forever in God’s presence through Christ’s Atonement by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel. The Book of Mormon is evidence of the love of God for His children. It shows that God speaks to His children. As you teach and testify, invite people to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its message. Each person you teach must decide whether to accept the Book of Mormon as revelation from God. Trust the remarkable promise in Moroni 10:3–5. Do all you can to persuade people to read the book, understand it, and ask God sincerely whether it is true. The witness of the Holy Ghost becomes the cornerstone of their faith that Christ has restored His Church. Help those you teach to receive that spiritual confirmation. #### Scripture Study (Page 22) How should you use the Book of Mormon in your missionary work? - Read 1 Nephi 13:39 2 Nephi 29:8–10, Moroni 10:3–5 D&C 20:5–16, D&C 42:12–14 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 22) Imagine that you are going to write an article about the message of the Restoration for a local newspaper. In your study journal write a title that describes the central message. Then record your thoughts and feelings about this message, including how understanding it better has changed the way you live and the way you view the world around you. ## Helping Others Make Commitments: The Door to Faith and Repentance (Page 22) Help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “The first thing you will do when an investigator tells you he or she had not read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! . . . Much of the time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the balance. . . . It is the most important path this investigator will ever walk. But if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! . . . So take control of this situation. Teach with power and authority, and then be devastated if the first steps toward commandment-keeping and covenant-keeping have not been successfully begun” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1997). As you teach people to understand the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel, you “declare repentance” (D&C 15:6). Repentance involves a change of heart and a desire to forsake sin and serve God. It involves humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to God’s will. It requires that people increase their commitment to live in agreement with God’s will. Repentance requires a sincere and lasting change of thoughts, desires, habits, and actions. It is a positive experience that brings joy and peace. Be bold and loving in helping people understand what they must do to repent. By inviting people to make commitments, you can effectively raise a voice of both warning and hope. #### Scripture Study (Page 22) What do these scriptures teach about declaring repentance? - Read Alma 29:1–4 Alma 42:31, Alma 62:45 D&C 14:8, and D&C 15:6; 16:6 for answersto the question. ## Baptism and Confirmation (Page 23) Baptizing and confirming the people you teach is central to your purpose. Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost brings a host of blessings to those who live worthy of it. Through these ordinances people enter the gate and continue on the path to eternal life. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said: “We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church. We do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives. . . . We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the sons and daughters of God. No one else can do this” (“The Purpose of Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1995). As you teach the restored gospel, help people understand the sacred nature of baptism and confirmation. Help them realize that receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is a great blessing in this life and a key to their salvation. The Holy Ghost will “teach [them] all things” (John 14:26). President Boyd K. Packer taught: “When you are teaching investigators and preparing them for baptism by water, you must also think of the gift of the Holy Ghost— baptism by fire. Think of it as one sentence. First comes the baptism of water and then the baptism of fire” (“The Gift of the Holy Ghost: What Every Missionary Should Know—and Every Member As Well,” seminar for new mission presidents, June 2003). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 5:499). Help those you teach understand that to qualify for baptism and confirmation they must meet the conditions given in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. ### D&C 20:37 Qualifications for Baptism (page 23) - Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Are willing to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins.

"In what ways does Moroni exemplify qualities that are essential for missionaries and members to emulate in their service and spiritual development, according to the context?","['worthy converts are baptized, they are confirmed members of the Church and the gift of the Holy Ghost is conferred upon them. This confirmation occurs under the direction of the bishop or branch president in a sacrament meeting soon after the baptism. While the two ordinances are separated by a brief time, confirmation complements and completes baptism. #### Scripture Study (Page 24) 1. In what ways is the gift of the Holy Ghost one of the greatest gifts we can receive? - Read 3 Nephi 19:1–13, D&C 45:56–57, John 3:5, John 14:26, Galatians 5:22–25, and Topical Guide: “Holy Ghost, Gift of” for answers to the question. 2. Why should converts desire the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Read 2 Nephi 31:12–17, 2 Nephi 32:1–5, Acts 8:14–17 and Acts 19:1–6 for answers to the question. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 24) Search the following scriptures and make a list of the qualifications and covenant of baptism. Discuss with your companion how to teach those requirements to others. - 2 Nephi 31:13 Mosiah 18:8–10 - Alma 7:14–16 3 Nephi 11:21–41 - Moroni 6:1–4 D&C 20:37 ## Establishing the Church (Page 24) When people have been baptized and confirmed members of the Church, continue to work with ward leaders and members to help these new converts adjust to their new life and continue their spiritual growth. The Church is established as people who have testimonies are baptized and confirmed, keep their covenants, prepare actively to go to the temple, and help strengthen the ward or branch. Converts who have member friends, who are given responsibility, and who are nourished by God’s word will grow in testimony and faith. Missionaries, ward leaders, and Church members should not turn away from their responsibility to nourish and strengthen new members. ## A Successful Missionary (Page 24) Your success as a missionary is measured primarily by your commitment to find, teach, baptize, and confirm people and to help them become faithful members of the Church who enjoy the presence of the Holy Ghost. Avoid comparing yourself to other missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts against theirs. Remember that people have agency to choose whether to accept your message. Your responsibility is to teach clearly and powerfully so they can make a correct choice. Some may not accept your message even when they have received a spiritual witness that it is true. You will be saddened because you love them and desire their salvation. You should not, however, become discouraged; discouragement will weaken your faith. If you lower your expectations, your effectiveness will decrease, your desire will weaken, and you will have greater difficulty following the Spirit. You can know you have been a successful missionary when you: - Feel the Spirit testify to people through you. - Love people and desire their salvation. - Obey with exactness. - Live so that you can receive and know how to follow the Spirit, who will show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Develop Christlike attributes. - Work effectively every day, do your very best to bring souls to Christ, and seek earnestly to learn and improve. - Help build up the Church (the ward) wherever you are assigned to work. - Warn people of the consequences of sin. Invite them to make and keep commitments. - Teach and serve other missionaries. - Go about doing good and serving people at every opportunity, whether or not they accept your message. When you have done your very best, you may still experience disappointments, but you will not be disappointed in yourself. You can feel certain that the Lord is pleased when you feel the Spirit working through you. #### Scripture Study (Page 25) How do servants of the Lord feel about the work? How do servants of the Lord influence those they serve? - Read Mosiah 28:3, Alma 8:14–15, Helaman 10:3–5, 3 Nephi 28:4–10, Ether 12:13–15, D&C 15:4–6, D&C 16:4–6 and D&C 68:2–6 for the answers to the questions. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 25) - Read Helaman 10:1–5 and 3 Nephi 7:17–18. How did the Lord feel about these missionaries and their service? - Think about the missionary efforts of Abinadi and Ammon (see Mosiah 11–18; Alma 17–20, 23–24). Why were both missionaries successful even though the immediate results of their efforts were different? - Record what you learn in your study journal. ### Remember This (Page 25) - Your purpose is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. - The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way by which we can find eternal happiness. - Your calling gives you authority; keeping your covenants gives you power. - The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. - You help people live the gospel by inviting them to make and keep commitments. - You show your love for the Lord and gratitude for His Atonement by bringing souls unto Him. - You are successful when you are obedient, live righteously, and do your best in helping others live the gospel. ## Missionary Work (Page 26) Following are statements made by Presidents of the Church in this dispensation. ### President Joseph Smith (1830–1844) (Page 26) “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel.

G. Homer Durham [1946], 124). ### President Lorenzo Snow (1898–1901) (Page 26) “There is no mortal man that is so much interested in the success of an elder when he is preaching the gospel as the Lord that sent him to preach to the people who are the Lord’s children” (The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow, comp.

Smith (1901–1918) (page 26) “We have a mission in the world: each man, each woman, each child who has grown to understanding or to the years of accountability, ought . . . to be qualified to preach the truth, to bear testimony of the truth” (Gospel Doctrine, 13th ed.

And it is our duty above all others to go forth and proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the restoration again to the earth of the plan of life and salvation. . . . We have in very deed the pearl of great price. We have that which is of more value than all the wealth and the scientific information which the world possesses. We have the plan of life and salvation. . . . The best way in the world to show our love for our neighbor is to go forth and proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, of which he has given us an absolute knowledge concerning its divinity” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1927, 175–76). ### President George Albert Smith (1945–1951) (Page 26) “That is your mission, my brethren and sisters of the Church, that is your responsibility. Freely you have received and our Heavenly Father will expect you freely to share with His other sons and daughters these glorious truths” (Sharing the Gospel with Others, sel. Preston Nibley [1948], 213). “We will attain our exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom only on the condition that we share with our Father’s other children the blessings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and observe the commandments that will enrich our lives here and hereafter” (Sharing the Gospel with Others, 190). ### President David O. McKay (1951–1970) (Page 27) “Every member . . . a missionary!” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1959, 122). “True Christianity is love in action. There is no better way to manifest love for God than to show an unselfish love for your fellow men. This is the spirit of missionary work” (Gospel Ideals [1954], 129). ### President Joseph Fielding Smith (1970–1972) (Page 27) “We have heard that we are all missionaries. Every member . . . is or ought to be a missionary; . . . as members of the Church, having pledged ourselves to the advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ we become missionaries. That is part of the responsibility of every member of the Church” (Take Heed to Yourselves [1971], 27–28). ### President Harold B. Lee (1972–1973) (Page 27) “Missionary work is but home teaching to those who are not now members of the Church, and home teaching is nothing more or less than missionary work to Church members” (Improvement Era, Dec. 1964, 1078). ### President Spencer W. Kimball (1973–1985) (Page 27) “Now is the moment in the timetable of the Lord to carry the gospel farther than it has ever been carried before. . . . Many a person in this world is crying, knowingly and unknowingly, ‘Come over . . . and help us.’ He might be your neighbor. She might be your friend. He might be a relative. She might be someone you met only yesterday. But we have what they need.

What role did Joseph Smith play in the Restoration according to the context?,"['. . . A great indicator of one’s personal conversion is the desire to share the gospel with others.” (“The Atonement and Missionary Work,” seminar for new mission presidents, June 1994). ### President Gordon B. Hinckley (1995–2008) (Page 27) “We are here to assist our Father in His work and His glory, ‘to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man’ (Moses 1:39). Your obligation is as serious in your sphere of responsibility as is my obligation in my sphere” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1995, 94; or Ensign, May 1995, 71). “Let there be cultivated an awareness in every member’s heart of his own potential for bringing others to a knowledge of the truth. Let him work at it. Let him pray with great earnestness about it” (“Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,” Ensign, May 1999, 106). ## Ideas for Study and Application (page 28) ### Personal Study (Page 28) - Prepare a two-minute talk on one of the questions at the beginning of this chapter. Be prepared to share your talk with your companion or with other missionaries in a district meeting. - Ask recent converts to tell their conversion stories. What helped them gain “faith unto repentance” (Alma 34:17)? Why did they decide to be baptized and confirmed? What was it like for them to become new members of the Church? How could missionaries have served them better? - Consider what it means to raise the voice of warning (see Jacob 3:12; D&C 1:4; 38:41; 63:57–58; 88:81; 112:5; Ezekiel 3:17–21; 33:1–12). Write in your own words what it means and how you can go about doing it. - Read Mormon 8 and Moroni 1 and 10. As you read, ask yourself, “What was Moroni’s hope for our day? What did he want us to do with the Book of Mormon? What would I say to Moroni if I had the chance?” Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Consider the events in your life that have strengthened your testimony of Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Then write an answer to this question: What has helped you know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith? ### Companion Study (Page 28) - Share with each other your answers to the questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. - Share with each other what your hopes and desires were for your mission when you received your mission call. To what extent does your experience thus far meet your expectations? How can you meet these expectations more fully? - Read and discuss “Ministry” in the Bible Dictionary. - Select one of the following great missionaries, and read the references listed. As you read, discuss how this missionary (1) understood and committed himself to his calling, (2) demonstrated his attitude and desire for the work, and (3) helped others accept the gospel. - Alma (Mosiah 18) - Aaron (Alma 22; 23:1–6) - Nephi and Lehi (Helaman 5) - Peter (Acts 2) - Paul (Acts 16) - In the hymnbook, select two hymns under the topic “Restoration of the Gospel” (see page 424). Read or sing the hymns. Discuss the meaning of the words. - Read together “Faith,” “Repentance,” “Baptism,” and “Holy Ghost” in the Bible Dictionary. Read and discuss all the scripture references in each entry. - Read together “Dispensations” in the Bible Dictionary. Also read and discuss Doctrine and Covenants 136:37. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 29) - Invite two or three recent converts to share their conversion experiences. How did they feel about the missionaries? about what the missionaries taught? about keeping commitments? What most strongly influenced their conversion? - Invite a priesthood leader to talk to the missionaries about the opportunities and difficulties of building the Church in your area. - Read Alma 18 and discuss these questions: What were Lamoni’s feelings at the beginning of the story? How did they change? What feelings must a person have in order to receive the blessings of the gospel? Read Alma 34:15–16, and compare it with Lamoni’s story. How does Christ’s Atonement enable us to obtain mercy? - Discuss what it means to be a successful missionary. Invite missionaries to give specific examples of success. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Assign one group to read Acts 2:36–38 (Peter), another group to read Acts 16:25–33 (Paul), and the final group to read Mosiah 18:8–11 (Alma). Ask each group to answer the question, “What did this missionary do to help others increase in faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation?” Discuss what the missionaries learn from these stories that could help them exercise faith when inviting people to repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. - Several days before the meeting, assign several missionaries to ponder selected questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. Ask each missionary to prepare a two- to three-minute talk on his or her assigned question. During the district meeting or zone conference, allow the missionaries to give their talks. Following the talks, discuss what they learned and how they could use it in their missionary work. - Divide the missionaries into four groups. Ask each group to list as many truths, covenants, and ordinances as they can that were restored and revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Have each group share their results. Invite missionaries to share how any of the truths revealed through the Restoration has influenced their lives. ### Mission President (Page 29) 1. During interviews, periodically ask missionaries to share with you: – Their testimony of Jesus Christ. – Their testimony of the restored gospel and the mission of Joseph Smith. – Their testimony of the Book of Mormon. – Their thoughts about their purpose as a missionary. 2. Invite missionaries to record in their study journal what they feel is the purpose of their mission. During an interview, ask them to share what they have written. 3.

Why is it important to study D&C 88:118 in the context of gospel study and preparation to teach others?,"['new members. > Beginning of Chapter 2 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach? (Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 32) Read Joseph Smith—History 1:11–13. Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.” – PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER “LITTLE CHILDREN,” ENSIGN, NOV. 1986, 17 #### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ## Studying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain']","D&C 88:118 emphasizes the importance of seeking the Lord's guidance in our study, stating that we should study the gospel diligently and with a desire to learn, so that our tongues may be loosed and we can be inspired by the Spirit.

How do you teach the Spirit?,"['the baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). #### Defining Words (Page 35) We have a powerful message with a unique vocabulary.

Follow the suggestions given above in creating a definition for each. ## Study Ideas and Suggestions (Page 36) Each of the ideas and suggestions in this section can make your study time more rewarding and spiritually uplifting. Consider the following as you plan your study: - Always begin with a prayer. - Plan study activities that will build your faith in the Savior and use your time productively. - Plan your study around people, their needs, and preparing them for baptism, confirmation, and enduring to the end. Note your study plans in your daily planner. - Plan your study by asking: What will I be teaching today? How can I plan my study to best help those I teach? Which ideas and suggestions from this section will I incorporate in my study? As you plan your study activities, experiment with some of the ideas and suggestions that follow or with additional ideas you learn from others. ### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ### See the Big Picture (Page 37) - Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background. - Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph. - Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain. - Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 37) Read the chapter summaries of the books below and write an outline that describes the setting, main events, and main doctrines of each book. - 1 Nephi - Moses - Acts ### Explore the Details (Page 38) - Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions. Examine surrounding words or phrases for clues to what the key words mean. - Look for connecting words, such as therefore, and again, thus, wherefore, and others. Then see how the preceding and following passages relate to each other. - Use the Topical Guide to']","Page 36 contains the 'Study Ideas and Suggestions' section, which offers guidance on planning and conducting effective and spiritually uplifting study sessions, including setting goals, applying principles, and using study resources.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Who was King Benjamin and what is his significance in gospel principles?,"['or two questions about the gospel principles and doctrines from one of the lessons in chapter 3 for which they would like to find an answer. Invite the missionaries to share their questions with the group. For each question, discuss the following: – How will answering this question bless the life of the missionary? – How will it bless the lives of investigators? – How could a missionary find the answer? 4. Ask several missionaries to share a gospel principle that their companions have taught them. Ask them to explain the principle and how their companion taught it to them. 5. Organize missionaries into companionships or small groups. Assign each group to read one chapter from the Book of Mormon. Have each group select one idea from each of the categories in the section “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Invite the groups to apply each suggestion as they read their chapter together. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for reading and discussion. Have each group explain the suggestions they used, how well the suggestions worked, and what they learned. 6. Invite each missionary to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to him or her (such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites). Invite the missionaries to sketch or describe how they visualize the accounts they have chosen. Invite two or three missionaries to share what they visualize. Ask others to tell the stories and relate them to doctrines in one of the lessons. Read Moroni 10:3 and discuss the value of pondering deeply about spiritual knowledge. ### Mission President (Page 41) 1. Invite missionaries to bring their study journals to interviews. Invite them to share one entry with you. 2. During interviews, ask some of the following questions: – What impressions have you had recently in your scripture study? – What is one gospel principle that your companion has recently taught you? – What chapter or section of this manual has helped you most in the past two weeks? – What are you doing in your personal study that helps you learn the most? 3. During zone conferences, invite missionaries to share meaningful experiences they have had in their personal and companion study. 4. During zone conferences, allow missionaries to share personal study ideas. 5. Share with missionaries insights you have had in your personal study. Share entries from your study journal and your testimony of the importance of gospel study. 6. As you can, join missionaries in their companion study. 7. During interviews, invite missionaries to share one of their lesson plans from one of the missionary lessons. Ask them what these doctrines mean to them. > Beginning of chapter 3 of the 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Do I Study and Teach? (Page 43) The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrines, principles, and commandments that you are to study, believe, love, live, and teach. They are what the living prophets and apostles have directed you to teach. They are organized so that you can help others clearly understand the doctrines of Christ. The lessons in this chapter are: 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 2. The Plan of Salvation 3. The Gospel of Jesus Christ 4. The Commandments 5. Laws and Ordinances Teach the first four lessons before baptism. Make sure those you teach qualify for baptism and confirmation by making and keeping all of the commitments in these lessons. Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching lessons before baptism with the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, new members are taught the first four lessons again, as well as “Laws and Ordinances.” Ward leaders determine whether ward missionaries or full-time missionaries lead out in ensuring that these lessons are taught and how long full-time missionaries are involved. Encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons. You should also use these lessons in individual and companion study, district meetings, and other training settings. As you study the scriptures and treasure up in your mind the doctrines in these lessons, the Spirit will give you in the very hour what you should say and do to help others receive a witness of the truthfulness of the teachings. As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and prepare to teach, keep firmly in mind these instructions. Make sure that you teach all the doctrines in these lessons. Unless directed by the Spirit, for each of the first three lessons, you should give the full content in the order in which they are written. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Each lesson outlines the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrines that you are to teach. Thoroughly learn the doctrines. Consistently focus on helping those you teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview']","King Benjamin is mentioned in the context of scriptures that have meaning to individuals, such as his sermon. The context invites missionaries to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has significance to them, including King Benjamin’s sermon, and to visualize or describe it. This indicates that King Benjamin is associated with a notable scriptural event, specifically his sermon, which holds importance in gospel principles.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What is Acts?,"['questions to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation. The lessons also have ideas for teaching. Use these suggestions to strengthen how you prepare and teach. ### The Role of Memorization (Page 44) Memorize scriptures to use in your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal points in each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language should focus their language study on preparing to teach the missionary lessons. They should memorize vocabu- lary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons. ### Teach with Clarity (Page 44) At the end of the first three lessons is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to make the message easy to understand. ### Scripture Study (Page 44) What are you directed to teach? Study Mosiah 18:18–20, D&C 43:15–16 and D&C 52:9 to find the answers to this question. Why must you study the doctrines in the lessons? Study Alma 17:2–3 and D&C 84:85 to find answers to this question. > Lesson One # 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 45) ## Your Purpose (Page 45) As you teach, prepare your investigators to meet the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the baptismal interview questions. This is best accomplished by inviting your investigators to make and keep the commitments listed below. ### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 45) - Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father? - Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world? - Do you believe that the Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith? - Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God? What does this mean to you? ### Commitments (Page 45) - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Other commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. > Lesson one: First Principle ## God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father (Page 45) God is our Heavenly Father. We are His children. He has a body of flesh and bone that is glorified and perfected. He loves us. He weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right. He wants to communicate with us, and we can communicate with Him through sincere prayer. He has given us this experience on the earth so we can learn and grow. We can show our love for Him through our choices and our obedience to His commandments. Heavenly Father has provided us, His children, with a way to be successful in this life and to return to live in His presence. However, we must be pure and clean through obedience in order to do so. Disobedience moves us away from Him. Central to our Father’s plan is Jesus Christ’s Atonement. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane as well as His suffering and death on the cross. Through the Atonement we can be freed from the burden of our sins and develop faith and strength to face our trials. ### Belief about God (Page 46) Determine what each person you are teaching understands regarding Christian beliefs about God. Many people in today’s world either have no concept of God or a very different perception of Deity. Two Book of Mormon missionaries, Ammon and Aaron, taught people who did not have a Christian background. They taught simple truths and invited their investigators to pray. Lamoni and his father were converted. Read Alma 18:24–40 and 22:4–23, and answer the questions below: - What did these missionaries teach about the nature of God? - How can you follow their examples? #### Scripture Study (Page 46) **What is the nature of God the Father and Jesus Christ?** Study the following scriptures to find answers to the question. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 Nephl 17:36 | 3 Nephl 27:13-22 | John 3:16-17 | | 2 Nephi 9:6 | D&C 38:1-3 | Acts 17:27-29 | | Mosiah 4:9 | D&C 130:22 | Romans 8:16 | | 3 Nephi 12:48 | Moses 1:39 | Hebrews 12:9 | | 3 Nephi 14:9-11 | Matthew 5:48 | 1 John 4:7-9 | > Lesson Two: Second Principle ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 46) The restored gospel blesses and helps husbands and wives, parents and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and spiritual strength in their families. These blessings are available now and in eternity. The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current concerns and challenges. Because families are ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in eternity. God has established families to bring happiness to His children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere, and prepare them for eternal life. The home is the best place to teach, learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing family members with peace, joy, and happiness. Through prophets in every age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for individuals and families. > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation (Page 46) One important way that God shows His love for us is by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the power and authority given']","The context does not provide a specific definition or explanation of Acts. It is mentioned as a term to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation, and the lessons include ideas for teaching and studying doctrines related to it.

Who is Eve in the context of prophets and gospel dispensations?,"['to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation. They in turn teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer. The teachings of prophets are found in sacred books called scriptures. Our Father’s plan for us to be successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus’ Atonement at the center of that plan. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can receive eternal life if we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. “This is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:21). All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to accept or reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles. Those who choose to obey are blessed, but those who ignore, reject, or distort the gospel do not receive God’s promised blessings. Whenever people choose to disregard, disobey, or distort any gospel principle or ordinance, whenever they reject the Lord’s prophets, or whenever they fail to endure in faith, they distance themselves from God and begin to live in spiritual darkness. Eventually this leads to a condition called apostasy. When widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority to teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel. Biblical history has recorded many instances of God speaking to prophets, and it also tells of many instances of apostasy. To end each period of general apostasy, God has shown His love for His children by calling another prophet and giving him priesthood authority to restore and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ anew. In essence, the prophet acts as a steward to oversee the household of God here on earth. Such periods of time headed by prophetic responsibility are called dispensations. God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to Adam and gave him priesthood authority. Adam was the first prophet on the earth. By revelation, Adam learned of mankind’s proper relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Adam and Eve taught their children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel in all aspects of their lives. Adam was followed by other prophets, but over time the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel and fell into apostasy, choosing to be unrighteous. Thus began the pattern of prophetic dispensations that makes up much of the recorded history of the Old Testament. Heavenly Father revealed His gospel through direct communication to prophets such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Each prophet was called by God to begin a new dispensation of the gospel. To each of these prophets God granted priesthood authority and revealed eternal truths. Unfortunately, in each dispensation people eventually used their agency to choose to reject the gospel and then fell into apostasy. ### Prophets (Page 48) Determine what the person you are teaching understands about prophets. In most cultures there are people who believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God as defined in the restored gospel. Explain clearly that God establishes His kingdom on the earth by calling a prophet to establish a new dispensation. He gives that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. You might wonder how gospel dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people understand that God loves His children and that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. #### Scripture Study (Page 48) Study about Prophets using the following scriptures: - Jacob 4:4, 6, Mosiah 8:13–18, Acts 10:34–43, and Amos 3:7 Study about Dispensations using the following scriptures: - D&C 136:36–38, Moses 5:4–12, 55–59, Moses 8:19–30, Bible Dictionary, “Dispensations” > Lesson One: Fourth Principle ## The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement (Page 48) A few hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ, people again fell into apostasy. But when the Savior began His mortal ministry He established His Church again on the earth. Heavenly Father sent His Son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son . . . that the world through him might be saved” (John 3:16–17). Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take upon Him, by His suffering, the sins of all who would live on this earth and to overcome physical death. The Savior made an infinite atoning sacrifice so that if we have faith in Him, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end, we can receive forgiveness of our sins and enter and follow the path that will lead us to eternal life in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 31:13–21). During His earthly ministry, the Savior taught His gospel and performed many miracles. He called twelve men to be His Apostles and laid His hands on their heads to give them priest- hood authority. He organized His Church, fulfilled prophecy, and was rejected and crucified. Most important, He completed the Atonement. The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, completed all that His Heavenly Father sent Him to do. Before the Savior’s death and Resurrection, He gave His Apostles authority to teach His gospel, perform the ordinances of']","The provided context does not mention Eve specifically.

What does the context say about the significance of Isaiah in relation to the Great Apostasy and the Restoration of the gospel?,"['## The Great Apostasy (Page 49) After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept the doctrines of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the doctrines were corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost. Without revelation and priesthood authority, people relied on human wisdom to interpret the scriptures and the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. False ideas were taught as truth. Much of the knowledge of the true character and nature of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was lost. The doctrines of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or forgotten. The priesthood authority given to Christ’s Apostles was no longer present on the earth. This apostasy eventually led to the emergence of many churches. After centuries of spiritual darkness, truth-seeking men and women protested against current religious practices. They recognized that many of the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel had been changed or lost. They sought for greater spiritual light, and many spoke of the need for a restoration of truth. They did not claim, however, that God had called them to be a prophet. Instead, they tried to reform teachings and practices that they believed had been changed or corrupted. Their efforts led to the organization of many Protestant churches. This Reformation resulted in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the final Restoration. The Savior’s Apostles foretold this universal apostasy. They also foretold that the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church would be restored once more upon the earth. #### Scripture Study (Page 49) Study these scriptures to learn more anout the great apostacy: - 1 Nephi 13, 2 Nephi 26:20–21, 2 Nephi 28, 4 Nephi 1:27, D&C 86:1–3, Matthew 24:9–11, Mark 12:1–9, Acts 3:19–21 - Acts 20:28–30, Galatians 1:6–9, 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 (JST verses 2, 3, 7–9), 1 Timothy 4:1–3, 2 Timothy 4:3–4, 2 Peter 2:1–2, Amos 8:11–12 - Topical Guide: “Apostasy of the Early Christian Church”, True to the Faith, “Apostasy,” pages 13–14 Our Search for Happiness, pages 23–32 Jesus the Christ, chapter 40, “The Long Night of Apostasy” #### The Great Apostasy (Page 50) Investigators must understand that a universal apostasy occurred following the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. If there had been no apostasy, there would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As guided by the Spirit, teach investigators about the Great Apostasy at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. **Key Points** - The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see Ephesians 2:19–20; 4:11–14). These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer upon others the priesthood authority. - People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see Matthew 24:9; 1 Nephi 11:32–34; 2 Nephi 27:5). With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation ceased, and doctrine became corrupted. - Even before the death of the Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. The simple doctrines and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see Isaiah 24:5). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrines from them (1 Nephi 13:26–40). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see 3 John 1:9–10). People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see 2 Timothy 4:3–4). - Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshiped according to the light they possessed and have received answers to their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). - Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy. > Lesson One: Sixth Principle ## The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith (Page 50) When the circumstances were right, Heavenly Father once again reached out to His children in love. He called a young man named Joseph Smith as a prophet. Through him the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth. Joseph Smith lived in the United States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at the time. It was at a time of great religious excitement in the eastern United States. His family members were deeply religious and constantly sought for truth. But many ministers claimed to have the true gospel. Joseph desired “to know which of all the sects was right,” (Joseph Smith—History 1:18). The Bible taught there was “one Lord, one faith, one baptism”']","The provided context does not mention Isaiah directly or discuss its significance in relation to the Great Apostasy or the Restoration of the gospel.

What is the meaning of Ephesians in the context of spiritual guidance?,"['(Ephesians 4:5). Joseph attended different churches, but he remained confused about which church he should join. He later wrote: *“So great were the confusions and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was . . . to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. . . . In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10).* As Joseph sought truth among the different faiths, he turned to the Bible for guidance. He read, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (James 1:5). Because of this passage, Joseph decided to ask God what he should do. In the spring of 1820 he went to a nearby grove of trees and knelt in prayer. He described his experience: *“I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. . . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17).* In this vision God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith. The Savior told Joseph not to join any of the churches, for they “were all wrong” and “all their creeds were an abomination.” He stated, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof” (Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Even though many good people believed in Christ and tried to understand and teach His gospel, they did not have the fulness of truth or the priesthood authority to baptize and perform other saving ordinances. They had inherited a state of apostasy as each generation was influenced by what the previous one passed on, including changes in the doctrines and in ordinances such as baptism. As God had done with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to the earth. After the appearance of the Father and the Son, other heavenly messengers, or angels were sent to Joseph Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery. John the Baptist appeared and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, which includes the authority to perform the ordinance of baptism. Peter, James, and John (three of Christ’s original Apostles) appeared and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, restoring the same authority given to Christ’s Apostles anciently. With this priesthood authority, Joseph Smith was directed to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth. Through him, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles. The time in which we live is referred to by Bible prophets as the last days, the latter days, or the dispensation of the fulness of times. It is the period of time just before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It is the final dispensation. This is why the Church is named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A living prophet directs the Church today. This prophet, the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is the authorized successor to Joseph Smith. He and the present Apostles trace their authority to Jesus Christ in an unbroken chain of ordinations through Joseph Smith. ### Memorize Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17 (Page 52) Memorize Joseph Smith’s description of seeing the Father and the Son (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17), and always be ready to describe the First Vision using his own words. Do not rush through it. Bear sincere testimony that you know it is true. Do not hesitate to explain how you came to know of its truth. Invite your companion to do so as well. ### Bear Testimony (Page 52) An important part of a missionary’s duty is to bear testimony of the current prophet and president of the Church. #### Scripture Study (page 52) Study 2 Nephi 3, D&C 112:30, Ephesians 1:10, Ephesians 4:5, James 1:5, and Brochure, The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith > Lesson One: Seventh Principle ## The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Page 52) Knowing that doubt, disbelief, and misinformation would remain after centuries of darkness, our loving Heavenly Father brought forth an ancient volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible, which contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. This volume of holy scripture provides convincing evidence that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God. This record is the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where gold plates had lain hidden for centuries. These gold plates contained the writings of prophets giving an account of God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Joseph Smith translated the contents of these plates by the power of God. The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of the Savior and taught His gospel. After His Resurrection, Christ appeared to these people. He taught them His gospel and established His Church. The Book of Mormon proves that “God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old” (D&C 20:11). In order to know that the Book of Mormon is true, a person must read, ponder,']","The provided context does not explicitly define or explain the meaning of Ephesians.

How Joseph Smith help us know the Book of Mormon is true?,"['and pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet.

God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel.

Wha is John the greatest gifts to His children and how does it relate to our eternal progression?,"['greatest gifts to His children. Our eternal progression depends on how we use this gift. We must choose whether to follow Jesus Christ or follow Satan. We are physically separated from God during life on earth, but He wants every one of His children to find peace in this life and a fulness of joy in His presence after this life. He wants us to become like Him. #### Scripture Study (Page 63) - **Children of God** - D&C 93:29, Acts 17:29, Hebrews 12:9 - **Purpose** - Moses 1:39, and John 17:3 - **Premortal Life** - D&C 138:53–56, Moses 3:5, Abraham 3:22–26, Jeremiah 1:5, and Topical Guide, “Man, Antemortal Existence of” > Lesson Two: Second Principle ## The Creation (Page 63) Under the direction of the Father, Jesus Christ created the earth as a place for us to live and gain experience. In order to progress and become like God, each of us had to obtain a body and be tested during a time of probation on the earth. While on the earth we are out of God’s physical presence. We do not remember our pre-earth life. We must walk by faith rather than by sight. #### Scripture Study (Page 63) - 1 Nephi 17:36, Alma 30:44, D&C 88:41–47 - Moses 2:1, Moses 6:63, Abraham 3:24–25 - JST, John 1:1–3 2, Corinthians 5:6–7 > Lesson Two: Third Principle ## Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve (Page 63) Adam and Eve were the first of God’s children to come to the earth. God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were created in God’s image, with bodies of flesh and bones. While Adam and Eve were in the garden, they were still in God’s presence and could have lived forever. They lived in innocence, and God provided for their needs. In the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam and Eve their agency. He commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Obeying this commandment meant that they could remain in the garden, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality. They could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain. Satan tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and they chose to do so. This was part of God’s plan. Because of this choice, they were cast from the garden and out of God’s physical presence. This event is called the Fall. Separation from God’s presence is spiritual death. Adam and Eve became mortal—subject to physical death, or separation of the body and spirit. They could now experience disease and all types of suffering. They had moral agency or the ability to choose between good and evil. This made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin. In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God’s spirit children could come to earth, obtain physical bodies, and be tested. Only in this way could God’s children progress and become like Him. ### Teaching about the Fall (Page 64) When first teaching this doctrine, do not teach everything you know about it. Explain very simply that God chose two of His children, Adam and Eve, to become the first parents on earth. After their transgression they were subject to both sin and death. By themselves they could not return to live with Heavenly Father. The Lord spoke to Adam and taught him the plan of salvation and redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ. By following that plan, Adam and his family could have joy in this life and return to live with God (see Alma 18:36; 22:12–14). #### Scripture Study (Page 64) - In the Garden: 2 Nephi 2, Moses 2:26–31, Moses 3:15–17, Moses 5:11, Genesis 1:26–31, Genesis 2:15–17 - The Fall: 2 Nephi 2:25, Alma 12:22–34, Moses 4, Moses 5:10–12, Genesis 3 > Lesson Two: Fourth Principle ## Our Life on Earth (Page 64) Life on earth is an opportunity and a blessing. Our purpose in this life is to have joy and prepare to return to God’s presence. In mortality we live in a condition where we are subject to both physical and spiritual death. God has a perfect, glorified, immortal body of flesh and bones. To become like God and return to His presence, we too must have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones. However, because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, every person on earth has an imperfect, mortal body and will eventually die. If not for the Savior Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father. Along with physical death, sin is a major obstacle that keeps us from becoming like our Father in Heaven and returning to His presence. In our mortal condition we often yield to temptation, break God’s commandments, and sin. During our life on earth each of us makes mistakes. Although it sometimes appears otherwise, sin always leads to unhappiness. Sin causes feelings of guilt and shame. Because of our sins, we are unable to return to live with Heavenly Father unless we are first forgiven and cleansed. While we are in mortality, we have experiences that bring us happiness. We also have experiences that bring us pain and sorrow, some of which is caused by the sinful acts of others. These experiences provide us opportunities to learn and to grow, to distinguish good from evil, and to make choices. God influences us to do good; Satan tempts us to commit sin. As with physical death, we cannot overcome the effects of sin by ourselves. We are helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ. #### Scripture Study (Page 65) - Probation or Testing Period: 2 Nephi 2:21, 2 Nephi 9:27, Mosiah 3:19, Alma 12:21–24, Alma 34:31–35, Alma 42:2–10, Abraham 3:25–26 - Choice: 2 Nephi 2:26–29, Joshua 24:15, For the']","The context explains that the greatest gifts to His children are related to our eternal progression, which depends on how we use this gift.

What is the significance of Alma in the context of the teachings on the Atonement?,"['Strength of Youth, “Agency and Accountability” - Good and Evil: Moroni 7:12–19 - Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:8–10, 1 John 3:4 - The Unclean Cannot Be with God: 1 Nephi 10:20–21, Alma 41:10–11, 3 Nephi 27:19, Moses 6:57 > Lesson Two: Fifth Principle ## The Atonement (page 65) Before the world was organized, our Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ made it possible for us to overcome the effects of the Fall. All of the prophets since the world began have testified of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer. We will all suffer physical death, but Jesus Christ overcame the obstacle of physical death for us. When He died on the cross, His spirit became separated from His body. On the third day, His spirit and His body were reunited eternally, never to be separated again. He appeared to many people, showing them that He had an immortal body of flesh and bone. The reuniting of body and spirit is called resurrection and is a gift promised to each of us. Because of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, we will all be resurrected regardless of whether we have done good or evil in this life. We will have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones that will never again be subject to disease, pain, or death. The resurrection makes it possible to return to God’s presence to be judged but does not guarantee that we will be able to live in His presence. To receive that blessing, we must also be cleansed from sin. God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to overcome the obstacle of sin in addition to the obstacle of physical death. We are not responsible for the Fall of Adam and Eve, but we are responsible for our own sins. God cannot look on sin with any degree of allowance, and sin prevents us from living in His presence. Only through the Savior’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin so that we can live with God again. This is possible through exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. To fulfill the plan of salvation, Christ paid the penalty for our sins. He alone was able to do that. He was called and prepared in pre-earth life. He was the literal Son of God in the flesh. He was sinless and completely obedient to His Father. Though tempted, He never gave in to temptation. When the Father asked His Beloved Son to pay the price of the world’s sins, Jesus was prepared and willing. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and His suffering and death on the cross, and it ended with His Resurrection. Though He suffered beyond comprehension—so much so that He bled from every pore and asked whether it were possible that this burden be lifted from Him—He submitted to the Father’s will in a supreme expression of love for His Father and for us. This triumph of Jesus Christ over spiritual death by His suffering and over physical death by His Resurrection is called the Atonement. Christ promises to forgive our sins on the condition that we accept Him by exercising faith in Him, repenting, receiving baptism by immersion, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and striving faithfully to keep His commandments to the end of our lives. Through continuing repentance, we may obtain forgiveness and be cleansed of our sins by the power of the Holy Ghost. We are relieved of the burden of guilt and shame, and through Jesus Christ we become worthy to return to the presence of God. As we rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In paying the penalty for our sins, Jesus did not, however, eliminate our personal responsibility. We must show that we accept Him and that we will follow His command- ments. Only through the gift of the Atonement can we return to live with God. #### Scripture Study (Page 66) - Resurrection: 2 Nephi 9:6–7, Alma 11:42–45, Alma 40:23, Helaman 14:15–19, D&C 88:27–32 Luke 24:1–10, 36–39, 1 Corinthians 15:20–23, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40, Topical Guide, “Resurrection”, Bible Dictionary - “Death,” “Resurrection” - Atonement: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, Alma 7:11–13, Alma 34:8–10, D&C 19:15–19, D&C 45:3–5, John 3:16–17, 1 John 1:7, Bible Dictionary, “Atonement” - The Gospel—The Way: 2 Nephi 9:1–24, 2 Nephi 31, Alma 11:40, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27, Moroni 7:27–28 > Lesson Two: Sixth Principle ## The Spirit World (page 66) Even though Christ conquered physical death, all people must die, for death is part of the process by which we are transformed from mortality to immortality. At death our spirits go to the spirit world. Death does not change our personality or our desires for good or evil. Those who chose to obey God in this life live in a state of happiness, peace, and rest from troubles and care. Those who chose not to obey in this life and did not repent live in a state of unhappiness. In the spirit world the gospel is preached to those who did not obey the gospel or have the opportunity to hear it while on earth.

How does Christ's Atonement relate to the doctrine of resurrection and eternal life?,"['righteousness and our guilt. If we have repented, we will receive mercy. We will be rewarded according to our works and our desires. Through the resurrection all people will become immortal—they will live forever. Immortality is a free gift to all people, whether they are righteous or wicked. Eternal life is not, however, the same as immortality. Eternal life is a gift of God given only to those who obey His gospel. It is the highest state that we can achieve. It comes to those who are freed from sin and suffering through the Atonement of Christ. It is exaltation, which means living with God forever in eternal families. It is to know God and Jesus Christ and to experience the life they enjoy. ### Resurrection and Reincarnation (Page 67) Some people may confuse the doctrine of resurrection with the concept of reincarnation. The concept of reincarnation involves being born into the world again in a different form and is false doctrine. The doctrine of resurrection involves receiving an eternal reward of an immortal body of flesh and bone. This is true doctrine. Make sure those you teach understand clearly the doctrine of the resurrection. > Lesson Two: Eighth Principle ## Kingdoms of Glory (Page 67) During our mortal lives we make choices regarding good and evil. God rewards us according to our works and desires. Because God rewards everyone according to deeds done in the body, there are different kingdoms of glory to which we may be assigned after the Judgment. Those who have repented of their sins and received the ordinances of the gospel and kept the associated covenants will be cleansed by the Atonement of Christ. They will receive exaltation in the highest kingdom, also known as the celestial kingdom. They will live in God’s presence, become like Him, and receive a fulness of joy. They will live together for eternity with those of their family who qualify. In the scriptures this kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun. People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars. #### Scripture Study (Page 68) - Resurrection and Restoration: 2 Nephi 9:14–15, Jacob 6:8–9,Alma 42:13–15, 22–23 - Judgment: 2 Nephi 28:23, Mosiah 3:23–25, Alma 5:15–21, Alma 12:12–14, D&C 132:12; 137:9 John 5:22 - Kingdoms of Glory: 3 Nephi 28:10, D&C 76: Introduction, D&C 76, D&C 137, Matthew 5:48, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40 - Eternal Life: 2 Nephi 31:17–21, D&C 14:7, D&C 29:43–44, D&C 45:8, D&C 93:19, John 3:16, John 17:3 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 68) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him. The plan focuses on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ in overcoming the effects of the Fall and making eternal life possible for us.

It gives us hope and helps us find peace, joy, and happiness. It tells us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. God is our Father, and He loves us. We are His children. We are part of His family, and we lived with Him before we were born on this earth. He has a plan of happiness that makes it possible for us to return to His presence after this life. Our progress depends on how we use our God-given agency, or ability to choose. As part of that plan, the Fall of Adam made it possible for us to come to earth, gain a physical body, have experience, and have families of our own. But the Fall also brought physical death, which is separation of the spirit from the body, and spiritual death, which is separation from God. Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan. Christ’s atoning sacrifice overcame the effects of both physical and spiritual death. We will all be resurrected and will live forever with physical bodies free of pain and sickness. Christ also made it possible to overcome spiritual death. As we live His gospel He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. As part of God’s merciful plan, we will all suffer a physical death. Our spirits will be separated from our bodies and will live for a time in the spirit world. We will then be resurrected with an immortal body, an eternal union of our body and spirit. We will be judged according to our works and desires. Those who have lived the gospel will receive our Father in Heaven’s greatest gift, the gift of eternal life in His presence.

Jesus Christ is central to that plan. – God’s plan of happiness makes it possible to return to His presence (see Moses 1:39). – Our eternal progression depends on how we use our agency (see 2 Nephi 2:27–29). - The Creation – Under the Father’s direction, Jesus Christ created the earth (see Hebrews 1:1–3). - Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve – Adam and Eve were created in God’s image (see Genesis 1:26–27). – In the Garden of Eden they were innocent and lived in God’s presence. – Because they partook of the forbidden fruit, they were cast out of the garden (see Moses 4:19–31). This is called the Fall. – They became mortal, were able to have children, and were also subject to sin and death (see 2 Nephi 2:22–25; Moses 5:11). - Our Life on Earth – Our purpose in life is to find lasting peace, joy, and happiness as families and to prepare to return to live with God. – We came to the earth to be tested (see Abraham 3:24–25). – We gain a body of flesh and bones, but we are subject to physical death. – God gives commandments. If we obey, we are blessed. If we disobey, we sin and receive the consequences. – All sin must be paid for, either by ourselves or by Christ (see D&C 19:15–20). – We make choices, and we all commit sin (see Romans 3:23). – We have experiences that bring us happiness and also sorrow. – We cannot overcome either physical or spiritual death without Christ. - The Atonement – Because Jesus Christ overcame physical death, we will all be resurrected (see Alma 11:41–43). – Through Christ’s Atonement we can become clean from sin so that we can return to live in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 9:8–9). – Christ will forgive our sins as we have faith in Him, repent, receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. - The Spirit World – All people must die. – At death our spirits go to the spirit world. – We live in either a state of misery or a state of peace and rest, depending on how we lived in this life. - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality – Our spirits and bodies will be reunited in the resurrection (see Alma 11:42–45; 40:23). – We will return to God’s presence to be judged according to our works and desires. – If we have repented, we will receive mercy. – Eternal life is a gift of God given to those who fully obey the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 14:7). - Kingdoms of Glory (see D&C 76; 137; 1 Corinthians 15:40–42). – We receive rewards according to our works and desires (see D&C 137:9). – Those who receive the gospel and live it valiantly throughout their lives will receive the celestial kingdom (see D&C 76:50–70). – Honorable people who are “blinded by the craftiness of men” and who are “not valiant in the testimony of Jesus [Christ]” receive the terrestrial kingdom (see D&C 76:75, 79). – Those who sin and do not repent will receive the telestial glory after they suffer and pay for their sins. **Commitments** - Will you pray to know that what we have taught is true? - Will you repent of your sins? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","Romans 3:23 states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, emphasizing our need for salvation through Jesus Christ.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
How does the concept of Romans relate to the principles of justice and mercy in the context of the Atonement and our personal responsibility as explained in the teachings for missionaries?,"['Nephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away']","The context explains that because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and desires. We are judged according to the laws of justice and mercy, where justice involves consequences for actions, and mercy is shown when God forgives sins and helps us return to His presence. The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent and keep His commandments, which is central to the teachings for missionaries. While Christ’s Atonement allows mercy to be extended, it does not eliminate personal responsibility; individuals must accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments to become worthy to enter God's presence. The teachings emphasize that sin is disobedience to God's commandments and results in separation from God, and through faith in Jesus Christ, we can rely on His grace and mercy to overcome sin and return to our Heavenly Father.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
How do we show our love for God?,"['from our sins and do them no more. We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper. Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son. Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions. In addition, we should continually improve—to develop Christlike qualities, to grow in knowledge, and to serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior expects of us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily. #### Scripture Study (Page 77) - We All Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:7–8 - Repentance: Alma 34:8–17, D&C 58:42–43, D&C 61:2, 2 Corinthians 7:9–10, Bible Dictionary, “Repentance” - Redemption and Forgiveness: Helaman 5:10–11 - Mercy Claims the Penitent: Alma 12:32–35, Alma 42:13, 21–24, D&C 18:10–13 > Lesson Three: Fourth Principle ## Baptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. #### Before Baptism (Page 78) “Ensure that [investigators] have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. Investigators should live the principles of moral worthiness, the Word of Wisdom, and commit to pay tithing. If missionaries feel additional preparation is needed, they should postpone baptism until the investigator meets the standard. *“Before baptism each investigator should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch president, and attend several sacrament meetings”* (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). #### Scripture Study (Page 79) - Christ’s Example: 2 Nephi 31:4–18, Matthew 3:13–17 - The Baptismal Covenant: Mosiah 5:8–10, Mosiah 18:8–10, D&C 20:37 - Qualifications']","Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper, and sincere repentance brings us His forgiveness and peace.

Who is Nephi and how is he important in the context of baptism and spiritual rebirth?,"['for Baptism: 2 Nephi 9:23, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 7:14–15, 3 Nephi 11:23–27, Moroni 6:1–4, D&C 20:37, Acts 2:37–39 - The Lord Institutes the Sacrament: 3 Nephi 18:1–18, Luke 22:15–20 - Promised Blessings of Baptism: Mosiah 4:11–12, 26, Moroni 8:25–26, John 3:5, Romans 6:4 - The Sacrament Prayers: Moroni 4 and 5, D&C 20:75–79 - Partaking of the Sacrament: D&C 27:2, 1 Corinthians 11:23–29 - Necessity for Authority: D&C 22, Hebrews 5:4 > Lesson Three: Fifth Principle ## The Gift of the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true.

We are greatly blessed as we keep our covenants with the Lord. - **Endure to the End:** To remain true to the commandments of God despite temptation, opposition, and adversity throughout life. - **Eternal Life:** To live forever as families in God’s presence (see D&C 132:19–20). Eternal life is God's greatest gift to man. - **Gospel:** God’s plan of salvation, made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The gospel includes the eternal truths or laws, covenants, and ordinances needed for mankind to return to the presence of God. - **Grace:** The enabling power from Jesus Christ that allows us to obtain blessings in this life and to gain eternal life and exaltation after we have exercised faith, repented, and given our best effort to keep the commandments. Such divine help or strength is given through the mercy and love of Jesus Christ. We all need divine grace because of Adam’s Fall and also because of our weaknesses. - **Mercy:** The spirit of compassion, tenderness, and forgiveness. Mercy is one of the attributes of God. Jesus Christ offers mercy to us through His atoning sacrifice on conditions of repentance. - **Restitution:** The return of something that has been taken away or lost. For example, the Restoration of the goepel is called a restitution (see Acts 3:19–21). The word restoration also refers to the restoration of the body (see Alma 41:10–15). ### Other Terms That May Need Further Definition for Those You Teach (Page 84) - Clean from sin - Prayer - Temptation - Confession - Sacrament - Forgiveness - Strait and narrow path > Lesson Four # The Commandments: Preparing for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 85) There are many ways to teach the commandments found in this lesson. For example, you might teach a few of the commandments from this lesson as part of the first three lessons, or you might teach several commandments as a single lesson. What you do should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. ## Prepare to Teach (Page 85) Your purpose in teaching the commandments is to help people live the gospel by exercising faith in Jesus Christ and repenting as they prepare for baptism and confirmation. By obeying the commandments, people will grow in their testimony of the gospel, show that they have “broken hearts and contrite spirits,” and begin to repent of all their sins (see Moroni 6:1–4; D&C 20:37). This lesson is organized differently from the first three. The first three lessons explain the doctrinal foundation for the gospel of Jesus Christ. This lesson explains specific commandments God has given that help us apply gospel principles in our lives. There are many ways to teach this lesson. The approach you take should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. Constantly think and pray about how to help investigators live the gospel. Ideas include: - Teaching one or more commandments as part of the first three lessons. When doing so, consider the principle taught in Alma 12:32: “God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption” (italics added). Certain commandments, such as prayer and scripture study, might be taught best as part of the first three lessons. Other commandments might be best taught after you have laid the doctrinal foundation of the gospel found in the first three lessons. - Teaching two or three of the commandments as a single lesson. - Teaching a single commandment as a lesson. - Teaching the commandments in the context of the gospel. Briefly review the lesson on the gospel of Jesus Christ before teaching one or more of the commandments. As you do so, you can help investigators see how the commandments fit into the larger picture of exercising faith in the Savior and repenting in preparation for baptism and confirmation. Their lives can be blessed as they see the gospel of Jesus Christ as a pattern for living. You may be able to teach some investigators in a few visits; others may require more visits. You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find""]","Page 84 includes questions to ask after teaching, key definitions such as confirmation and covenant, and other terms related to preparing for baptism and confirmation. It emphasizes the importance of understanding doctrines like the gift of the Holy Ghost, covenants, and commandments, and provides guidance on how to teach these principles effectively to help investigators prepare for their baptism and confirmation.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What does Moroni 10:2 exhort us to do?,"['the Spirit in missionary work? - How can I recognize the promptings of the Spirit? ## Personal Revelation (Page 103) Joseph Smith said, “Salvation cannot come without revelation; it is in vain for anyone to minister without it” (History of the Church, 3:389). You will succeed in your work as you learn to receive and follow personal revelation. Joseph Smith also taught that revelation is vital for your daily work: “This is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed” (History of the Church, 5:135). God loves you and all His children. He is anxious to support you in your practical and specific challenges. You have been promised inspiration to know what to do and have been given the power to do it (see D&C 43:15–16). He will help you as you try to recognize and understand the Spirit through diligent scripture study. He will guide you to people who will receive the message of the Restoration. He will give you power to deliver the message and to testify of Christ and His gospel. He will shower His blessings upon you through the gift of the Holy Ghost. He asks that you remain worthy of this gift and that you ask, seek, and knock (see D&C 4:7; Matthew 7:7–8). We live in the day prophesied by Book of Mormon prophets—a day when people will “contend one with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance” (2 Nephi 28:4; see also 3 Nephi 29:6; Mormon 9:7–8). Yet many people also yearn for spiritual things. As you learn to receive personal revelation, you will teach with power and authority (see Alma 17:3) because the Holy Ghost gives you power to speak (see 1 Nephi 10:22). You need to seek and receive personal revelation through the Holy Ghost as you help people become baptized and confirmed. Have faith that you will receive personal revelation to guide you from day to day. The Holy Ghost will help you in every aspect of your work. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 104) In Moroni’s concluding testimony, he wrote “a few words by way of exhortation” (Moroni 10:2). Read Moroni 10 and write in your own words what Moroni exhorts the reader of the Book of Mormon to do. (Exhort means to encourage strongly or urge someone to do something.) ## The Light of Christ (Page 104) A person is capable of receiving spiritual guidance before being baptized and confirmed. This spiritual influence begins with the Light of Christ, which “is given to every man, that he may know good from evil” (Moroni 7:16; see also verses 14–19). “The light of Christ is just what the words imply: enlightenment, knowledge, and an uplifting, ennobling, persevering influence that comes upon mankind because of Jesus Christ. . . . “The light of Christ should not be confused with the personage of the Holy Ghost, for the light of Christ is not a personage at all. Its influence is preliminary to and preparatory to one’s receiving the Holy Ghost. The light of Christ will lead the honest soul who ‘hearkeneth to the voice’ to find the true gospel and the true Church and thereby receive the Holy Ghost” (Bible Dictionary, “Light of Christ,” 725; see also D&C 84:46–47). President Boyd K. Packer said, “It is important for a . . . missionary . . . to know that the Holy Ghost can work through the Light of Christ. A teacher of gospel truths is not planting something foreign or even new into an adult or a child. Rather, the missionary or teacher is making contact with the Spirit of Christ already there. The gospel will have a familiar ‘ring’ to them” (“The Light of Christ,” address delivered at the seminar for new mission presidents, 22 June 2004, 2). ## The Holy Ghost (Page 104) - **The personage of the Holy Ghost.** The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. He is a personage of spirit and does not have a body of flesh and bones (see D&C 130:22). He is the Comforter, who the Savior promised would teach His followers all things and bring to their remembrance all things that He had taught them (see John 14:26). - **The power of the Holy Ghost.** The witness that comes to sincere investigators before baptism comes through the power of the Holy Ghost. “The power [of the Holy Ghost] can come upon one before baptism, and is the convincing witness that the gospel is true. It gives one a testimony of Jesus Christ and of his work and the work of his servants upon the earth” (Bible Dictionary, “Holy Ghost,” 704). The Holy Ghost testifies of truth. All people can know the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon through the power of the Holy Ghost. “By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things” (Moroni 10:5). - **The gift of the Holy Ghost.** Investigators who receive a witness do not yet have the promise of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Smith said: “There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him” (History of the Church, 4:555). “The gift [of the Holy Ghost] can come only after proper and authorized baptism, and is conferred by the laying on of hands. . . . The gift of the Holy Ghost is the right to have, whenever one is worthy, the companionship of the Holy Ghost” (Bible Dictionary, “Holy']","In Moroni’s concluding testimony, he wrote “a few words by way of exhortation,” which means to encourage strongly or urge someone to do something. The context indicates that Moroni exhorts the reader of the Book of Mormon to seek and receive personal revelation, to learn to recognize the Spirit, and to be guided by it in their faith and missionary work.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What is the significance of the Holy Ghost in the process of conversion and sealing according to the teachings in the context?,"['Ghost,” 704). As a member of the Church, you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost by priesthood authority. This gift entitles you to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as you remain worthy of it. Pray for the Spirit’s guidance, and valiantly follow the promptings you receive. “The gift of the Holy Ghost comes after one repents and becomes worthy. . . . The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ so deeply that no earthly power or authority can separate him from that knowledge."" – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST—A SURE COMPASS,” ENSIGN, APR. 1996, 4 - **The Holy Spirit of Promise.** The Holy Ghost is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise (see D&C 88:3). To be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable to God. The Holy Spirit of Promise testifies to the Father that the saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants associated with them have been kept. Those who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has (see D&C 76:51–60; Ephesians 1:13–14). All covenants and performances must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise if they are to be valid after this life (see D&C 132:7, 18–19, 26). Breaking covenants may remove the sealing. - **Gifts of the Spirit.** The gifts of the Spirit are special spiritual blessings that the Lord gives to worthy individuals for their own benefit and for their use in blessing others. For example, missionaries who must learn a new language may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help in learning a language. Several gifts of the Spirit are described in Moroni 10:8–18; Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33; and 1 Corinthians 12:1–12. These are only some examples of the many gifts of the Spirit. The Lord may bless you in other ways depending on your faithfulness, your needs, and the needs of those you serve. You should desire spiritual gifts and earnestly seek for them (see D&C 46:8; 1 Corinthians 12:31; 14:1, 12). These gifts come by prayer, faith, and works, according to God’s will (see D&C 63:9–12; 84:64–73). #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 106) Read the references below: - Bible Dictionary, “Holy Ghost,” “Light of Christ,” and “Spirit.” - Our Search for Happiness, 84–86, 91–92. - True to the Faith, “Holy Ghost,” 81–84, and “Spiritual Gifts,” 165–67. Write a description of the nature and role of the Holy Ghost. - Read Acts 4:23–33. - How did Peter and John seek spiritual gifts? - How did the Lord answer their prayers? - What can you learn from this experience about your own work? ## The Power of the Spirit in Conversion (Page 106) The power of the Holy Ghost is central to conversion. Strive to understand the doctrine of conversion and also the experience of conversion. President Boyd K. Packer explained the central role of the Spirit in conversion: “When conversion takes place, it is through the power of the Spirit. In order to succeed in missionary work, these three things must occur: “We must understand what an investigator must feel in order to receive conversion. “We must understand how a missionary must feel in order to teach with the converting power of the Spirit. “And then we must understand how a member must feel to succeed in participating in the conversion experience” (mission presidents’ conference, 3 Apr. 1985). The better you understand how investigators, missionaries, and members feel when they receive the witness of the Spirit, the better you will understand your own role, which is to: - Be edified and have your mind enlightened as you search the scriptures and teach the doctrine. - Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear witness. You do this by teaching and testifying of the message of the Restoration. Teach as directed by the Spirit, and testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true. - Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting the message to each person’s needs. - Invite people to act. Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and make and keep covenants. Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke of the power of the Spirit: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed. When individuals . . . feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word. This is how we come to feel the gospel is true” (“Now Is the Time,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 75). The Holy Ghost works in the hearts of people to bring about these changes. As people choose to keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly and will develop the faith to obey Christ. Thus, you should help the people you work with grow in faith by inviting them to repent and to make and keep commitments. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 107) - Read one or two of the following passages, and ponder what an investigator must feel to be converted. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and members: 2 Nephi 4:16–35; Enos 1; Mosiah 4–5; 18:7–14; 27–28; Alma 5; 17–22; 32; 36; 38 - Read one or two of the following passages and ponder what you as a missionary and as a member must feel to teach with converting power. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and']","The Holy Ghost, also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise, plays a central role in conversion and sealing. It bears witness of the truth, impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and Jesus Christ, and confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable to God. Being sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost confirms the proper performance of ordinances and the keeping of covenants, allowing individuals to receive all that the Father has. The gift of the Holy Ghost is received after repentance and worthiness, and it entitles members to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as long as they remain worthy.

What does the scripture teach about Moroni's role in faith and prayer?,"['members: 1 Nephi 8:11–12; Mosiah 28:1–4; Alma 26; 29; 31:26–38; 32; Moroni 7:43–48; D&C 4; 18:10–16; 50:21–22 #### Scripture Study (Page 107) **What do these scriptures teach about the power of the Spirit in your work?** - 2 Nephi 33:1–2, D&C 42:11–17, D&C 50:13–22, Acts 2:37–38 - 1 Corinthians 2:11–14 Bible Dictionary, “Conversion” **What can you do to enjoy the power of the Spirit in your work?** - Alma 32:27–28, D&C 42:14, John 7:17 **Why is it important to teach what you know and believe?** - Alma 5:43–47, D&C 52:9, D&C 80:4 ## Pray with Faith (Page 107) You can teach in the Lord’s way only by the power of the Spirit, and you receive the Spirit through the prayer of faith. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (D&C 42:14). As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” (2 Nephi 33:1). President Gordon B. Hinckley illustrated this principle by relating an experience from his mission: “I always remember two young men who served in my mission. One was a superstar. He was educated. He was bright. He was quick. He was a little arrogant. We had another who was a sign painter. He came from a sign shop with very little education, but he knew his inadequacies and he relied on the Lord. When he prayed, you knew he was talking with the Lord. It wasn’t a rote thing, it was a conversation and that young man accomplished wonders while the other young man went through the motions. The power that was in the one and the absence of power in the other was so apparent. Call upon the Lord. He has extended the invitation, and He will answer” (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 469). Strive to pray sincerely, with real intent, and with “all the energy of heart” (Moroni 7:48). Effective prayer requires great effort (see Moroni 10:3–4; D&C 8:10; 9:7). Give serious thought to your attitude and to the words you use. Consider the following when you pray: - Use the language of prayer, which shows that you love and respect your Heavenly Father. Use proper and respectful language in whatever language you speak. For example, in English use scriptural pronouns such as Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine. - Always express gratitude for your blessings. A conscious effort to be grateful will help you recognize how merciful the Lord has been in your life. - Pray specifically for the guidance and help of the Holy Ghost. Show that you value this blessing by being sensitive to and aware of spiritual promptings. Then courageously follow those promptings. - Pray with love and charity. Pray for people by name. Ask for inspiration to help you understand and meet their needs. Pray for the welfare of contacts, investigators, new converts, and less-active members. Pray for the members and priesthood and auxiliary leaders in your area. Pray for your family at home. Pray for your companion, other missionaries, and your mission president. Pray to know how you can help others, and then be willing to sacrifice in their behalf. - Pray that you will be shown where to go and what to do. Pray that you will be led to those who are prepared to receive the message of the Restoration. Pray that you will recognize them. - Recognize that your Heavenly Father knows what you need better than you do. Rely on the Spirit to know what to pray for (see 3 Nephi 19:24; D&C 46:28, 30). - In your prayers at night, give the Lord an accounting of your day’s activities. Then review with Him your plan for the next day. Listen for the promptings of the Spirit. - Pray to overcome temptation. Yielding to temptation interferes with the Spirit. - Pray and, when appropriate, fast for special blessings. - Pray about and ponder the scriptures. The scriptures open the window to revelation. - Believe that God will answer your prayers. Recognize that God’s thoughts are not your thoughts (see Isaiah 55:8–9), and trust God to answer your prayers in His own way and in His own time. “Every morning . . . , missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will be teaching. If they will do this, a new light will come into their lives. There will be greater enthusiasm for the work. They will come to know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking in His behalf. They will find a different response from those they teach. As they do so by the Spirit, their investigators will respond under the influence of the same Spirit.” – PRESIDENT GORDON B. HINCKLEY “MISSIONARY SERVICE,” FIRST WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP TRAINING MEETING, 11 JAN. 2003, 20 #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 109) Ponder the following statements concerning sincere prayer: “The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries—we place our order and hang up. We need to meditate, contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for and then speak to the Lord as one man speaketh to another” (Gordon B. Hinckley, Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley, 469). “If prayer is only a spasmodic cry at the time of crisis, then it is utterly selfish, and we come to think of God as a repairman or a service agency to help us only in our emergencies. We should remember the Most High day and night—always—not only at times when all other assistance has failed and we desperately need help” (Howard W. Hunter, The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter, ed. Clyde J. Williams [1997], 39). #### Scripture Study (Page 109) **Why must you pray']","The provided context does not explicitly mention Moroni's role, but it emphasizes the importance of prayer, faith, and relying on the Spirit in missionary work.

How Alma teach us about recognizing Spirit promptings?,"['for the Spirit?** - 2 Nephi 32:8–9, D&C 42:14, D&C 50:13–22 **What should you pray for?** - Alma 6:6, Alma 13:28, Alma 34:17–27 - Alma 37:36–37, 3 Nephi 18:20, 3 Nephi 19:9 - D&C 50:29–30 Bible Dictionary, “Prayer” ## Learn to Recognize the Promptings of the Spirit (Page 110) The Spirit is always available to guide and direct you. However, the Spirit speaks quietly, through your feelings as well as your mind. One great challenge for you and those you work with is to recognize the quiet, subtle promptings of the Holy Ghost. President Boyd K. Packer taught: “The voice of the Spirit is described in the scripture as being neither ‘loud’ nor ‘harsh.’ It is ‘not a voice of thunder, neither . . . voice of a great tumultuous noise.’ But rather, ‘a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper,’ and it can ‘pierce even to the very soul’ and ‘cause [the heart] to burn.’ (3 Ne. 11:3; Hel. 5:30; D&C 85:6–7.) Remember, Elijah found the voice of the Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but was a ‘still small voice.’ (1 Kgs. 19:12.) “The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all. (No wonder that the Word of Wisdom was revealed to us, for how could the drunkard or the addict feel such a voice?) “Occasionally it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed. But most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come seeking and listening and say in our manner and expression, like Samuel of ancient times, ‘Speak [Lord], for thy servant heareth.’ (1 Sam. 3:10.)” (“The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). Many voices in the world compete for your attention, and they can easily drown out spiritual impressions if you are not careful. In answer to the question, “How do we recognize the promptings of the Spirit?” President Gordon B. Hinckley read Moroni 7:13, 16–17 and then said: “That’s the test, when all is said and done. Does it persuade one to do good, to rise, to stand tall, to do the right thing, to be kind, to be generous? Then it is of the Spirit of God. . . . “If it invites to do good, it is of God. If it inviteth to do evil, it is of the devil. . . . And if you are doing the right thing and if you are living the right way, you will know in your heart what the Spirit is saying to you. “You recognize the promptings of the Spirit by the fruits of the Spirit—that which enlighteneth, that which buildeth up, that which is positive and affirmative and uplifting and leads us to better thoughts and better words and better deeds is of the Spirit of God” (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley, 260–61). God answers your prayers through personal inspiration and revelation. Through the Holy Ghost He will guide you in your finding efforts, as you teach the restored gospel, and as you strengthen less-active members and new converts. Your task is to live worthily, pray fervently, and learn to recognize and follow courageously the Spirit’s guidance. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 110) Study the following table.

How does D&C 31:11 guide missionaries in relying on the Spirit for their service and teaching efforts?,"['Constrains (impels forward) or restrains (holds back). | | D&C 50:13-22 | Edifies both teacher and students. | | D&C 88:3; John 14:26 | Gives comfort. | ## Relying on the Spirit (Page 111) As the Lord’s servant, you are to do His work in His way and by His power. Some missionaries feel confident that they know how to be successful. Others lack such confidence. Remember, however, that your confidence and faith should be in Christ, not in yourself. Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and abilities. Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Spirit is basic to teaching and preaching: “No man can preach the Gospel without the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 2:477). “Some few were called and ordained by the Spirit of revelation and prophecy, and began to preach as the Spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened by the power of God” (History of the Church, 4:538). “[Joseph Smith] proceeded to give instruction to the Elders respecting preaching the Gospel, and pressed upon them the necessity of getting the Spirit, so that they might preach with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven” (History of the Church, 4:13). During your weekly and daily planning sessions, you will need to ask some basic questions every day—even many times each day (see the Scripture Study box that follows for examples of questions). Seek inspiration to answer these questions in a way that meets each situation. The answers should then take shape in your plans. But you should also be willing to follow the Spirit and change your plans when unforeseen opportunities arise. Study the following scriptures and consider how they answer these important questions that you should ask each day. Consider what these passages mean for your finding efforts, planning sessions, and personal and companion study. Also consider their meaning as you teach the lessons, invite people to make commitments, follow up on commitments, strengthen new members and less-active members, and work with members. #### Scripture Study (page 112) - Where should I go? - Helaman 10:17, D&C 31:11 - D&C 75:26–27, D&C 79:1–2 - What should I do? - 1 Nephi 4:6, 2 Nephi 32:2–5 - D&C 28:15, D&C 52:3–4 - What should I say? - 2 Nephi 33:1, Alma 5:43–46, Alma 11:22, Helaman 5:18, Helaman 13:3–5 - D&C 33:8–10, D&C 50:13–22, D&C 68:1–4, D&C 75:3–11, D&C 100:5–8 - Matthew 10:19–20, Mark 13:11, 1 Corinthians 2:4–5...12–13, Exodus 4:10–12 - How do I adapt my teaching to the needs of my investigators? - Alma 12:7, Alma 41:1 - 3 Nephi 17:2–3, D&C 71:1, D&C 84:85 - Which scriptures should I use and how should I use them? - Mosiah 18:19-20, D&C 32:4, D&C 71:1 - Mosiah 27:35, D&C 42:11-17, D&C 80:4 = D&C 18:32-36, D&C 68:1-4, Luke 24:13-32 ## A Word of Caution (Page 112) As you pray for inspiration, you should also confirm your feelings. For example, compare your decisions with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets. Be certain that the feelings are consistent with the assignment you have; for example, you will not receive revelation to tell a local bishop how he should perform in his calling. Discuss your decisions and conclusions with your companion, your district leader, or your mission president when appropriate. President Howard W. Hunter offered this counsel: “Let me offer a word of caution. . . . I think if we are not careful . . . , we may begin to try to counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means. I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit. Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” (The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter, 184). The Spirit of the Lord always edifies. Revelation and spiritual experiences are sacred. They should be kept private and discussed only in appropriate situations. As a missionary, you may be more aware of spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life. Resist the temptation to talk freely about these experiences. President Boyd K. Packer counseled: “I have learned that strong, impressive spiritual experiences do not come to us very frequently. And when they do, they are generally for our own edification, instruction, or correction. Unless we are called by proper authority to do so, they do not position us to counsel or to correct others. “I have come to believe also that it is not wise to continually talk of unusual spiritual experiences. They are to be guarded with care and shared only when the Spirit itself prompts you to use them to the blessing of others” (Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). “If worthy, we are entitled to receive revelations for ourselves, parents for their children, and members of the Church in their callings. But the right of revelation for others does not extend beyond our own stewardship.” – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “COMMUNION WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT,” ENSIGN, MAR. 2002, 4. #### Scripture Study (Page 113) Relying on the Spirit is so important that the Lord warns us very strongly not to deny or quench the Spirit. What do you learn from the following passages of scripture? - Jacob 6:8–9 3 Nephi 29:5–6 - Mormon 9:7–9 Moroni 10:7–8 - D&C 11:25–26 1 Thessalonians 5:19–20 #### Remember This (Page 113) - Pray with faith that your prayers will be answered. - Learn to understand, recognize, and follow the promptings of the Spirit. - Learn to rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Teach others how to recognize the Spirit. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 114) ### Personal Study (Page 114) - Record your spiritual experiences in your journal. For']","D&C 31:11 emphasizes the importance of relying on the Spirit rather than one's own talents and abilities. It teaches that the Spirit is fundamental to teaching and preaching, and that missionaries should seek inspiration to guide their actions, plans, and teaching. The section encourages missionaries to ask basic questions daily—such as where to go, what to do, and what to say—and to follow the Spirit's promptings, adjusting their plans as needed. It also highlights that the Spirit edifies both teacher and students, gives comfort, and is essential for success in missionary work, aligning with the broader counsel that confidence and faith should be in Christ and His Spirit.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"How do the principles of repentance and scripture study, as emphasized in the context, support the process of developing faith in Jesus Christ and preparing to receive His mercy through the Atonement, especially considering the importance of prayer and obedience to God's commandments?","['<1-hop>\n\nNephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away', '<2-hop>\n\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven. - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - Faith in Jesus Christ - Repentance - Baptism, Our First Covenant - The Gift of the Holy Ghost - Endure to the End **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

Scripture study, such as reading Alma 11:40 and John 3:16–17, reinforces our understanding of Christ's love and the significance of His Atonement. By combining sincere repentance with diligent scripture study and prayer, we strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ, recognize His role as our Savior, and accept His mercy. This process helps us develop Christlike attributes, trust in His promises, and prepare ourselves to receive His forgiveness and the gift of the Holy Ghost, ultimately enabling us to return to the presence of Heavenly Father.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about.

This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital. There may be times when you call the investigators to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment. Help investigators identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message. Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments. Investigators are changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are with them. Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 215) - Write in your daily planner your plans for daily contact with each investigator. Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with investigators. - Choose one commitment invitation you will extend when you teach the lessons. Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment. Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns. #### Remember This (Page 215) - Focus on inviting people to make commitments in every finding or teaching situation, both with those who are not members of the Church and with Church members. - Extend commitment invitations to help people experience conversion. - Promise blessings. - Bear testimony. - Follow through to help people keep commitments. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 216) ### Personal Study (Page 216) - Identify a commandment listed in either lesson 4 or 5. Think of the blessings you have received from obeying this commandment, and write them in your journal. - In a letter, ask your family members how they have been blessed by obeying a specific commandment (for example, tithing). - Write how you feel about extending commitments. Are you bold or timid? Are you confident that people will be blessed, or do you have doubts? Are you consistent, patient, and helpful as you make daily contact? Do the people know you love them? How can you correct any weakness you identify in your invitations? - Review your lesson plans for each lesson. Do you include specific commitments? Does your lesson plan lead clearly to commitments? ### Companion Study (Page 216) - From your daily planner, make a list of people you have contacted in the past two days, including investigators and members. For each person, write the commitment(s) they made and other invitations you could have or should have extended. Discuss why you were able to obtain commitments from some of these people and what prevented you from obtaining commitments from others. What will you do to follow up on these commitments? - Look at your daily planner, and write the names of specific investigators you will teach in the next day or two. Consider which commandment(s) listed in lessons 4 and 5 you will invite them to live. Discuss how you will extend the commitment and the specific blessings you will promise for obedience. - Consider showing the Teaching Record to investigators to let them know what will be expected. If appropriate, share a copy with them. - Review the Notes/To Do List in your planner for the past three days to see if you have written your assignments to follow up on every invitation you have extended. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 216) - Discuss effective and creative ideas for daily contact with investigators. How have missionaries worked with members effectively? What printed or audiovisual materials are useful? What can you do when people are not home or are too busy to see you? - Discuss ways that missionaries have effectively taught the commandments in lessons 4 and 5. - Discuss specific concerns of some current investigators. What are the nature of these concerns? What can the missionaries do to resolve the concerns? ### Mission President (Page 216) - Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach. Help them focus on helping people make and keep commitments. - Encourage priesthood leaders and members to actively participate in making daily contact with investigators. - Be an example of extending invitations in your missionary efforts and with the missionaries you serve. > Beginning of chapter 12 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation?

As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (Moroni 8:25). The baptismal interview is the way established by the Church to ensure that each candidate meets the Lord’s standards for baptism and is prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Through this interview, baptismal candidates fulfill the scriptural requirement that they witness before an authorized representative of the Church that they have “truly repented of all their sins” (D&C 20:37). The commitments that investigators make prepare them to make and keep the covenant of baptism. People who have kept the commitments that you invited them to make will be well prepared for the interview and for membership and activity in the Church. As you teach investigators and prepare them for baptism and confirmation, make sure that they meet the qualifications for baptism. #### Qualifications for Baptism (Page 218) 1. **Doctrine and Covenants 20:37:**']","The Spirit plays a vital role in guiding investigators to recognize the truth of Joseph Smith's role in the Restoration by testifying of the gospel's truthfulness as they keep commitments and receive personal revelation. As they read, pray, and attend church, the Spirit testifies of the divine origin of the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith's prophetic calling, helping them feel the influence of the Spirit and understand the message of the Restoration more deeply.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

He is a member of a mission presidency with two counselors. Counselors in the mission presidency, like counselors in a stake presidency or bishopric, help organize and assist in the work. Counselors in the mission presidency do not address matters of missionary worthiness. > 2.1.3 ### Mission Leadership Organization Your mission president uses revelation and priesthood keys to organize the work. He assigns young missionaries to be trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants. Assistants, office missionaries, and other missionaries do not make missionary leadership assignments or assign the areas where you serve. However, the mission president may counsel with his wife or his assistants about missionary assignments. Your mission leaders and the assistants, zone leaders, and sister training leaders are members of the mission leadership council. These leaders counsel about meeting the needs of the missionaries and make plans to help the mission progress and to move the work forward. > 2.1.4 ### Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities Young missionary leaders, like all missionaries, follow the counsel of Jesus Christ to “serve [God] with all [their] heart, might, mind and strength” and to “remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence” (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2, 6). Leadership assignments do not indicate special recognition or advancement or reflect the worth of a missionary. Young missionary leaders have the responsibility to: - Find, teach, baptize, and fellowship people. - Set an example of missionary standards for behavior (see 3.0). - Train other missionaries and lead companion exchanges (see 2.3.1). - Share information and direction from the mission leadership council with the missionaries they lead. - Love and befriend other missionaries. Help them recognize the value of their efforts. - Listen to other missionaries’ concerns. Give support and counsel. - Correct other missionaries kindly and privately, as needed, followed by “an increase of love” (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–43). - Work closely with local leaders and members. Like all missionaries, elders and sisters with leadership assignments should practice Christlike leadership. If the conduct of any missionary, including young missionary leaders, seems inconsistent with the commandments and missionary standards, discuss the issue with the missionary. If the issue is not then resolved, share your concerns with your young missionary leaders or mission president and not with other missionaries, members, or friends. For more information about the specific assignments and responsibilities of young missionary leaders (trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants to the president), see section 7.1, “Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities.” > 2.1.5 ### Personal Responsibilities “Magnify [your] office unto the Lord” (Jacob 1:19), become spiritually self-reliant, and “act for [yourself]” (2 Nephi 2:16) by trusting the Lord and following the Spirit. When you have questions or concerns: Apply the teaching to “study it out in your mind; then … ask me if it be right” (Doctrine and Covenants 9:8). Seek guidance through personal revelation; prayer; and study of the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets, and these standards. If you need additional help after applying these principles, ask your companion or young missionary leaders. Often, they can help you find answers to your questions and resolve your concerns. If not, reach out to either of your mission leaders, your parents, or your home priesthood leaders. Please do not contact Church headquarters. If you do, you will be referred back to your mission president. Talk with your mission president about worthiness issues. Talk with either of your mission leaders about immediate safety concerns, including assault or abuse, or other issues that cannot be resolved with other missionaries. There may be times during your mission when you find it difficult to focus on your work due to current challenges, personal or family matters, or even past experiences. That is understandable. Do not hesitate to share your concerns with your companion, young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders and to reach out for support. Remember the Savior’s invitation: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen” (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36–37). > 2.2 ## Companions The Lord calls missionaries to preach His gospel in companionships. “Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands” (Doctrine and Covenants 52:10). You will work with different companions throughout your mission. Companions: Become united in the work and together testify of Jesus Christ. Support each other’s spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. Try to keep each other safe. Are accountable to each other in keeping missionary standards. > 2.2.1 ### Supporting Each Other Companions should help each other learn, grow, and develop Christlike attributes (see Doctrine and Covenants 4 and “How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 6). Learning patience and love, practicing forgiveness, and accepting differences in personalities will bless you throughout your life. As companions: - Love, respect, and strengthen each other. - Study together every day and pray together frequently throughout the day. - Be humble and recognize each other’s strengths. - Treat each other as you would like to be treated. - Avoid criticism and contention. - Avoid speaking negatively about each other to other missionaries, Church members, or family and friends at home. If you notice any inappropriate situation or behavior, discuss it with your companion. If the matter is not resolved or if your companion is being abusive, have the courage and love for your companion to ask your mission president for help (see 3.9.2). > 2.2.2 ### Staying Together Staying with your companion will help provide protection from physical and spiritual dangers, false accusations, and loneliness. Obey this missionary standard at all times and in all places. Never be alone.

There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes),', '<3-hop>\n\nNephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away', '<4-hop>\n\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven. - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - Faith in Jesus Christ - Repentance - Baptism, Our First Covenant - The Gift of the Holy Ghost - Endure to the End **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

Will']","Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection are central to developing Christlike attributes and the process of repentance in missionary work because they provide the foundation for forgiveness, mercy, and the opportunity for individuals to become more like Jesus Christ. The Atonement satisfies the demands of justice, allowing Heavenly Father to show mercy and forgive sins when individuals sincerely repent. Developing Christlike attributes such as love, patience, humility, and charity helps missionaries and investigators emulate Christ’s character, which is essential for effective service and personal growth. Repentance, enabled by Christ’s Atonement, involves recognizing sins, feeling godly sorrow, confessing, and turning away from wrong behaviors, thus aligning one’s life with Christ’s teachings. Both concepts emphasize that through Christ’s sacrifice, individuals can be cleansed from sin, develop Christlike qualities, and return to live with Heavenly Father, making them integral themes in missionary efforts to help others come unto Christ.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel. Previous dispensations have ended in apostasy (see D&C 136:36–38). – Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets all taught the gospel (see Moses 5:4–12). - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement – The Son of God restored and taught the gospel. He performed many miracles (see Bible Dictionary, “Miracles,” 732–33). – He called Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to preach the gospel and perform saving ordinances such as baptism (see John 15:16). – Christ established His Church. – Christ was crucified, and His Apostles were rejected and killed (see Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:25). – Christ accomplished the Atonement (see Bible Dictionary, “Atonement,” 617). - The Great Apostasy – Without revelation through a prophet, people fall into spiritual darkness (see Amos 8:11–12). – Prophets and Apostles foretold the Great Apostasy (see 2 Thessalonians 2:1–3). - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith – Joseph sought for truth (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10). – God and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17). – Like prophets in earlier dispensations, Joseph Smith was called as the prophet of this last dispensation. – God restored the fulness of the gospel through Joseph Smith (see D&C 35:17; 135:3). – Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Christ’s Church was organized (see D&C 13; 27:12). – A living prophet directs the Church today. - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ – The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. – Joseph translated the plates by the power of God (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraph 5). – The Book of Mormon proves that God inspires prophets in our day as He has in every dispensation (see D&C 20:5–12). – The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 20:8–9). - Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost – You can know that the Book of Mormon is true (see Moroni 10:3–5; Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 1, 8–9). – The Holy Ghost will teach you through your thoughts and feelings (see D&C 8:2–3). **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. #### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 58) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - If there were a prophet on the earth today, what would you ask him? - Do you believe that God hears your prayers?

I don’t know if I can ever do this!’ Although Brother Snider accepted what we taught and was always warm and friendly, he was deeply concerned about how his family would react to his joining another church. “After several weeks of watching Brother Snider struggle, my companion and I felt impressed to again read 3 Nephi 11 with the Sniders. I will never forget what happened that night. As we opened the Book of Mormon, my companion explained, ‘This chapter, as you might recall, recounts the Savior’s visit to the people in the Book of Mormon. Here we read about the Savior’s love for these people and what He taught them.’ We each took turns reading a verse or two. After reading through verse 5, my companion interrupted and said, ‘I have always been impressed with the description given here of the voice they heard. The voice was not harsh, it was not loud, and although it was a small voice, it had a powerful piercing effect on them. This voice was not only heard with their ears, but it spoke to their hearts.’ I watched the Sniders as they listened intently to my companion. “After some discussion about prayer and listening to the Spirit, it was Brother Snider’s turn to read: ‘And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them: Behold my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.’ Brother Snider paused, looking intently at his Book of Mormon. Then he looked up at me and said, ‘Heavenly Father was really proud of His Son, wasn’t He?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. Brother Snider looked back at his book again and stared at the open pages as if deep in thought. Finally he said, ‘I would want Heavenly Father to be proud of me too. I wonder how He would introduce me. I guess, if I . . . well, if I want Him to be proud of me then I had better do what He wants me to do.’ ‘Yes, I think that would be important,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ Brother Snider continued. ‘I think I’ve been worrying too much about what everybody else thinks and not enough about what God thinks.’ After a brief pause Brother Snider nodded and with a determined look said, ‘I think I had better be baptized.’ His response was so unexpected that my companion and I looked at him with blank stares. Finally, my companion said, ‘Yes, that would be the right thing to do. In fact, later on in this chapter the Savior teaches . . .’ As my companion talked I felt a burning in my heart and gratitude for the power']","The context shows that reading and praying about the Book of Mormon can help individuals gain a spiritual witness that it is the word of God. In 2 Nephi 2, Christ’s attributes and actions are highlighted, emphasizing His role as the Savior and the importance of His teachings. Moroni 10 teaches that through sincere prayer and the Holy Ghost, one can receive a spiritual witness of the truth of the Book of Mormon. Together, these passages support the theme that the Book of Mormon is a powerful testimony of Jesus Christ and can provide a spiritual witness when approached with faith and prayer.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How does the Spirit of the Lord help strengthen faith as described in the context of personal revelation and gospel teachings?,"['<1-hop>\n\n**Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel. Previous dispensations have ended in apostasy (see D&C 136:36–38). – Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets all taught the gospel (see Moses 5:4–12). - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement – The Son of God restored and taught the gospel. He performed many miracles (see Bible Dictionary, “Miracles,” 732–33). – He called Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to preach the gospel and perform saving ordinances such as baptism (see John 15:16). – Christ established His Church. – Christ was crucified, and His Apostles were rejected and killed (see Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:25). – Christ accomplished the Atonement (see Bible Dictionary, “Atonement,” 617). - The Great Apostasy – Without revelation through a prophet, people fall into spiritual darkness (see Amos 8:11–12). – Prophets and Apostles foretold the Great Apostasy (see 2 Thessalonians 2:1–3). - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith – Joseph sought for truth (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10). – God and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17). – Like prophets in earlier dispensations, Joseph Smith was called as the prophet of this last dispensation. – God restored the fulness of the gospel through Joseph Smith (see D&C 35:17; 135:3). – Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Christ’s Church was organized (see D&C 13; 27:12). – A living prophet directs the Church today. - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ – The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. – Joseph translated the plates by the power of God (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraph 5). – The Book of Mormon proves that God inspires prophets in our day as He has in every dispensation (see D&C 20:5–12). – The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 20:8–9). - Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost – You can know that the Book of Mormon is true (see Moroni 10:3–5; Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 1, 8–9). – The Holy Ghost will teach you through your thoughts and feelings (see D&C 8:2–3). **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. #### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 58) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - If there were a prophet on the earth today, what would you ask him? - Do you believe that God hears your prayers?

"How does the role of the Holy Ghost in teaching, testifying, and guiding relate to the importance of companion exchanges and training in missionary work, especially considering the need to be constantly led by the Spirit as emphasized in the context?","['<1-hop>\n\nshould be able to see and hear your companion at all times unless you are in the bathroom, in an interview with a mission leader, or conducting a baptismal interview (see 2.3.6). You should sleep in the same room but not the same bed. When doing individual tasks while in your housing, use common sense to protect yourselves and follow missionary standards of behavior (see 3.0). Do not create time to be alone. For example, do not stay up later or get up earlier than your companion. If you and your companion become separated, contact your mission president immediately. > 2.2.3 ### Working in Your Area “Go and labor with [your] mights” (Jacob 5:72), and concentrate your efforts in your assigned teaching area. Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88). You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2). If you need to leave your area for another reason, request permission from your district leader to leave your area within your district or from your zone leaders if you need to travel outside of your district. You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone. If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders. - In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer. - District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district. - Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone. - Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones. - Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president. - A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should: - Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate. - Plan the companion exchange in advance. - Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping. - Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel. - Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching. - Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve. - Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement. - Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange. - Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president. > 2.3.2 ### Transfers The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office. - If your companion is transferred and you are', '<2-hop>\n\nactivities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ## The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power? Study Alma 17:2–3, D&C 53:3, 1 Corinthians 2:4 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 19) Look at the painting of Christ ordaining the Apostles, and then read John 15:1–16. - In what way is Christ the vine? How are you a branch of that vine? How does your setting apart relate to this relationship? - Read again your ministerial certificate. Record your feelings and thoughts about what you read. Each time you study this chapter, repeat this process. Note how your feelings change over time. - Study Doctrine and Covenants 109:13–15, 21–30, 38–39, 55–57, which are excerpts from the Prophet Joseph Smith’s inspired dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple. What blessings did Joseph Smith request for the faithful? ## The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 19) The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work. The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will,']","The context highlights that missionaries should be able to see and hear their companions at all times, emphasizing the importance of companionship and constant cooperation. It also details the significance of companion exchanges, where leaders teach, train, and learn from missionaries to strengthen their skills and spiritual capacity. The themes of teaching by the Spirit and the Holy Ghost's role in guiding, testifying, and teaching truths are central to effective missionary work. When missionaries engage in companion exchanges and training, they are encouraged to rely on the Holy Ghost to teach them new truths, give words in the moment, and carry their message to the hearts of those they teach. This reliance on the Spirit ensures that their teaching is divine, powerful, and effective, aligning with the doctrinal standards and emphasizing that the Holy Ghost is essential for teaching the gospel by divine power. Therefore, the role of the Holy Ghost directly supports the purpose of companion exchanges and training by enabling missionaries to teach with divine power, testify of truth, and be guided in their efforts to help others make and keep covenants.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How does living gospel principles for happiness and peace relate to maintaining honesty and Christlike behavior during missionary service?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with', '<2-hop>\n\nand His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ### Consider This (Page 15) - What is my purpose as a missionary? - What is the gospel? - Why do we preach the gospel? - Why must I teach with power and authority? - What is the message of the Restoration? Why is it so important? - What is my responsibility in helping others become converted? - How will I know whether I am a successful missionary? > Questions to help study this chapter by looking for the answers ## Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 15) You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. All of them are children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (D&C 59:23), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of guilt that come from mistakes and sins. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (2 Nephi 2:6, 8). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, Title Page). As your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great . . . importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (2 Nephi 2:8). President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world. That is the cause that must unite us today. Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167). You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. To come to the Savior they must have faith in Him unto repentance— making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenants of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). ### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11. In this vision, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God (see 1 Nephi 11:21–22). - In the vision, what did the people need to do to be able to partake of the fruit? What do we need to do to receive all the blessings of the Atonement? In what ways do commitments and covenants help us partake of these blessings? - As a missionary, what is your duty in helping others find and partake of the fruits of the gospel? - What did Lehi desire after he had eaten the fruit? (See 1 Nephi 8:10–18.) ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 17) The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for families: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational']","Living gospel principles for happiness and peace are closely connected to maintaining honesty and Christlike behavior, as described in the missionary standards. The section emphasizes developing Christlike attributes such as kindness, humility, and obedience, which foster trust and respectful interactions. Honesty in dealings, including truthful reporting and responsible use of resources, reflects integrity and aligns with living gospel principles. By practicing these virtues, missionaries can create a positive environment that promotes happiness, peace, and effective service, fulfilling their purpose to serve others with love and integrity.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately. For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders.

Why is it so important? - What is my responsibility in helping others become converted? - How will I know whether I am a successful missionary? > Questions to help study this chapter by looking for the answers ## Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 15) You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. All of them are children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (D&C 59:23), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of guilt that come from mistakes and sins. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (2 Nephi 2:6, 8). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, Title Page). As your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great . . . importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (2 Nephi 2:8). President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world. That is the cause that must unite us today. Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167). You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. To come to the Savior they must have faith in Him unto repentance— making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenants of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). ### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11.

"How sharing and explaining gospel principles from chapter 3 help missionaries invite people to follow Jesus Christ through baptism, especially when they pray and read the Book of Mormon to confirm the truth of the restoration?","['<1-hop>\n\nor two questions about the gospel principles and doctrines from one of the lessons in chapter 3 for which they would like to find an answer. Invite the missionaries to share their questions with the group. For each question, discuss the following: – How will answering this question bless the life of the missionary? – How will it bless the lives of investigators? – How could a missionary find the answer? 4. Ask several missionaries to share a gospel principle that their companions have taught them. Ask them to explain the principle and how their companion taught it to them. 5. Organize missionaries into companionships or small groups. Assign each group to read one chapter from the Book of Mormon. Have each group select one idea from each of the categories in the section “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Invite the groups to apply each suggestion as they read their chapter together. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for reading and discussion. Have each group explain the suggestions they used, how well the suggestions worked, and what they learned. 6. Invite each missionary to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to him or her (such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites). Invite the missionaries to sketch or describe how they visualize the accounts they have chosen. Invite two or three missionaries to share what they visualize. Ask others to tell the stories and relate them to doctrines in one of the lessons. Read Moroni 10:3 and discuss the value of pondering deeply about spiritual knowledge. ### Mission President (Page 41) 1. Invite missionaries to bring their study journals to interviews. Invite them to share one entry with you. 2. During interviews, ask some of the following questions: – What impressions have you had recently in your scripture study? – What is one gospel principle that your companion has recently taught you? – What chapter or section of this manual has helped you most in the past two weeks? – What are you doing in your personal study that helps you learn the most? 3. During zone conferences, invite missionaries to share meaningful experiences they have had in their personal and companion study. 4. During zone conferences, allow missionaries to share personal study ideas. 5. Share with missionaries insights you have had in your personal study. Share entries from your study journal and your testimony of the importance of gospel study. 6. As you can, join missionaries in their companion study. 7. During interviews, invite missionaries to share one of their lesson plans from one of the missionary lessons. Ask them what these doctrines mean to them. > Beginning of chapter 3 of the 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Do I Study and Teach? (Page 43) The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrines, principles, and commandments that you are to study, believe, love, live, and teach. They are what the living prophets and apostles have directed you to teach. They are organized so that you can help others clearly understand the doctrines of Christ. The lessons in this chapter are: 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 2. The Plan of Salvation 3. The Gospel of Jesus Christ 4. The Commandments 5. Laws and Ordinances Teach the first four lessons before baptism. Make sure those you teach qualify for baptism and confirmation by making and keeping all of the commitments in these lessons. Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching lessons before baptism with the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, new members are taught the first four lessons again, as well as “Laws and Ordinances.” Ward leaders determine whether ward missionaries or full-time missionaries lead out in ensuring that these lessons are taught and how long full-time missionaries are involved. Encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons. You should also use these lessons in individual and companion study, district meetings, and other training settings. As you study the scriptures and treasure up in your mind the doctrines in these lessons, the Spirit will give you in the very hour what you should say and do to help others receive a witness of the truthfulness of the teachings. As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and prepare to teach, keep firmly in mind these instructions. Make sure that you teach all the doctrines in these lessons. Unless directed by the Spirit, for each of the first three lessons, you should give the full content in the order in which they are written. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Each lesson outlines the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrines that you are to teach. Thoroughly learn the doctrines. Consistently focus on helping those you teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview', '<2-hop>\n\nand pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet.

When members or others provide meals: - Be respectful of their personal situations and time. - Be grateful for the food they offer. - Ask to teach a 15- or 20-minute lesson before or after the meal to strengthen those you visit and to provide you with an opportunity to improve your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Another adult of your own gender should be present with you and your companion when you eat a meal with someone of the opposite gender. > 2.5 ## Preparation Day Your mission president will assign one day each week as a preparation day. Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing. If you have a teaching appointment, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | > 2.6 ## Sabbath Day Activities Plan activities on the Sabbath that help you fulfill your missionary purpose to find, teach, baptize, and help others learn about and become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). You', '<2-hop>\n\n#### Activity: Companion Study (Page 191) With your companion, practice different ways to begin a lesson using several of these suggestions. ## Adjust Your Teaching to Meet Needs (Page 191) Each person or family you teach is unique. Even though you will not understand all of their interests, achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to their circumstances. Regardless of needs or problems, all people are best helped as they accept and live the gospel. You will be able to adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the Spirit. You may alter the order of the lessons as you are inspired to adapt to the investigators’ interests and needs. You may use more than one meeting to teach the principles in one lesson, and occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons in a single meeting. Heavenly Father knows His children, so rely on inspiration to make these decisions as you teach. Pray for the gift of discernment, and pay attention to thoughts that come to your mind or feelings you have about what to teach. You will need to adjust your teaching to give more attention to those commitments that are more difficult for an investigator to keep. For example, one person may easily accept the Book of Mormon as the word of God, while another may struggle to accept anything but the Bible. One person may have trouble giving up tobacco but will readily accept the law of tithing. As you plan when to teach certain doctrines, be sensitive about how much new information you share. Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the investigators. Some will progress faster or slower than others. Make sure that you ask enough questions and listen carefully to their answers so you have a firm understanding of how quickly and how well the investigator is learning and applying the doctrines you are presenting. Be sensitive to time. Most teaching appointments should not last beyond 45 minutes. A teaching visit can be completed, however, in 15 or 20 minutes if needed. If the person has only 15 minutes to meet with you, adjust your teaching to respect that limitation. Trust in the promise that the Spirit will give you “in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say” (D&C 100:6). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 192) Imagine that you are walking down the street and notice an older man struggling to place some heavy bags into a garbage can. You and your companion help him, and as a result he asks who you are. After some discussion he invites you into his home and agrees to hear your message. During the initial conversation he tells you that: - His wife died a year ago, and he really misses her. - He tires easily because of a heart condition. - He wonders more now than ever before whether God exists. What might you teach him? How could you adjust your teaching to best meet his needs and concerns? #### Scripture Study (page 192) - What does it mean to give “that portion that shall be meted unto every man”? - Alma 29:8, D&C 84:85 - What has the Lord promised faithful missionaries? - D&C 68:2–4, D&C 100:5–8, Matthew 10:19–20 ## Teach with Your Companion in Unity (Page 192) The Lord has commanded, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” (D&C 42:6). Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work together in unity. As you plan and study each day, discuss how you will teach so that you can be united and teach with one voice. Your teaching will be more powerful if you and your companion alternate giving brief portions of the lesson. Avoid falling into a routine when presenting the message. Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths of which he or she has testified. Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something. As companions, be ready to yield to each other so that you do not hinder the guidance of the Spirit. When you speak, maintain eye contact with the investigator. When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the investigator’s responses. #### Scripture Study (Page 193) - How do companions support one another? - Alma 12:1, D&C 42:6, D&C 52:9–10 ## Invite Members to Help You Teach (Page 193) Whenever possible invite members, preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the investigators. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of missionary work. It also provides friendship for the investigator. President Thomas S. Monson taught: *During the teaching process investigators can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new investigators so that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps the second or third visit. Can you appreciate, for example, when missionaries are working with those from the United Church of Canada, the strength of']","Missionaries can build trust and community service by engaging in personal service and understanding, as emphasized in themes like building relationships through personal service. The context highlights that daily activities should focus on interacting with people, respecting their situations, and offering service, which aligns with the theme of community service and discipleship. Adjusting teaching to meet individual needs involves being sensitive to circumstances, listening carefully, and tailoring lessons accordingly, which fosters trust and demonstrates genuine care—key aspects of building relationships and trust through personal service and understanding.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How do safety protocols and appropriate conduct relate to reporting and handling dangerous situations during missionary service, and what specific steps should missionaries take to ensure their safety and uphold doctrinal standards in such circumstances?","['<1-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with', '<2-hop>\n\nis a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders. Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately. For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders. Support and strengthen them through your words and example,']","Safety protocols and appropriate conduct are essential components of reporting and handling dangerous situations during missionary service. Missionaries are instructed to immediately report any problem or unsafe situation to their mission leaders, especially if it involves danger or misconduct. They are advised to leave any location or situation that makes them uncomfortable and to listen to spiritual promptings, including leaving a location if they sense danger. In cases of dangerous situations, missionaries must follow established safety protocols, such as reporting incidents promptly, leaving unsafe environments, and seeking guidance from mission leaders. Upholding doctrinal standards, including Christlike behavior, honesty, and respect for others, supports a safe and respectful environment. These steps help missionaries protect themselves physically and spiritually, ensuring they conduct themselves with integrity and safety while fulfilling their service responsibilities.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does the testimony and spiritual witness of the Book of Mormon support its status as the Word of God, as demonstrated through the personal experiences in the context?","['<1-hop>\n\n**Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel. Previous dispensations have ended in apostasy (see D&C 136:36–38). – Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets all taught the gospel (see Moses 5:4–12). - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement – The Son of God restored and taught the gospel. He performed many miracles (see Bible Dictionary, “Miracles,” 732–33). – He called Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to preach the gospel and perform saving ordinances such as baptism (see John 15:16). – Christ established His Church. – Christ was crucified, and His Apostles were rejected and killed (see Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:25). – Christ accomplished the Atonement (see Bible Dictionary, “Atonement,” 617). - The Great Apostasy – Without revelation through a prophet, people fall into spiritual darkness (see Amos 8:11–12). – Prophets and Apostles foretold the Great Apostasy (see 2 Thessalonians 2:1–3). - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith – Joseph sought for truth (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10). – God and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17). – Like prophets in earlier dispensations, Joseph Smith was called as the prophet of this last dispensation. – God restored the fulness of the gospel through Joseph Smith (see D&C 35:17; 135:3). – Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Christ’s Church was organized (see D&C 13; 27:12). – A living prophet directs the Church today. - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ – The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. – Joseph translated the plates by the power of God (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraph 5). – The Book of Mormon proves that God inspires prophets in our day as He has in every dispensation (see D&C 20:5–12). – The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 20:8–9). - Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost – You can know that the Book of Mormon is true (see Moroni 10:3–5; Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 1, 8–9). – The Holy Ghost will teach you through your thoughts and feelings (see D&C 8:2–3). **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. #### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 58) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - If there were a prophet on the earth today, what would you ask him? - Do you believe that God hears your prayers?

Make a list of the different names and titles for Christ used in these chapters. Underline the spoken words of Christ. Highlight His attributes and His actions. You might want to continue this practice as you read the entire Book of Mormon. - Write in your study journal how you felt when you first gained a spiritual witness that the Book of Mormon is true. - D&C 20:17 uses the phrase “by these things we know” to introduce doctrines taught and clarified by the Book of Mormon. Read D&C 20:15–35 and make a list of the doctrines mentioned. Select one of these doctrines and use the Topical Guide to compare your list to what the Bible teaches about these doctrines. - Compare the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5–7 and Christ’s sermon at the temple in 3 Nephi 12–14. Make a list of the plain and precious truths restored through the Book of Mormon. - Make a list of questions that investigators have asked. Find Book of Mormon passages that answer those questions, and use them as needed in your daily teaching. - Find a Book of Mormon scripture that has changed your life. Record your feelings about this scripture in your study journal. - Locate each instance in the Book of Mormon where the words of someone’s prayer are recorded. In your study journal, write the common elements of these prayers. - Read 2 Nephi 33:10–15 and Moroni 10:27–29, 34. What will you tell Nephi and Moroni at the judgment bar about your use of the Book of Mormon? Write your response and set goals to improve. - From the chapter headings of Mosiah 11–16, write a summary of what Abinadi taught. Read these chapters and expand your summary. - From the chapter headings of Mosiah 2–5, write a summary of what King Benjamin taught. Read these chapters and expand your summary. - As you read daily from the Book of Mormon, record in your study journal the passages that impress you. Write how you will apply them in your life. ### Companion Study (Page 126) - Read Book of Mormon passages together. Share what you have learned and felt. Also bear your testimonies to each other. - Which Book of Mormon prophet or missionary would you like to be like and why? Share your response with your companion. - Read Alma 26 and 29 as companions. Share how you feel about your mission. Write your feelings in your study journal. - Read Alma 37:9 and discuss how critical the scriptures were to Ammon and his fellow missionaries. Find references describing how they used the scriptures. - Read Alma 11–14 with your companion, one taking the role of Alma or Amulek and the other the detractors. Note how these missionaries responded to difficult questions. - Read the following true account and discuss what you learn concerning the importance and power of the Book of Mormon (names have been changed). “When we invited the Sniders to be baptized and confirmed, Sister Snider was ready, but Brother Snider said, ‘Don’t get your hopes up, Elders. I don’t know if I can ever do this!’ Although Brother Snider accepted what we taught and was always warm and friendly, he was deeply concerned about how his family would react to his joining another church. “After several weeks of watching Brother Snider struggle, my companion and I felt impressed to again read 3 Nephi 11 with the Sniders. I will never forget what happened that night. As we opened the Book of Mormon, my companion explained, ‘This chapter, as you might recall, recounts the Savior’s visit to the people in the Book of Mormon. Here we read about the Savior’s love for these people and what He taught them.’ We each took turns reading a verse or two. After reading through verse 5, my companion interrupted and said, ‘I have always been impressed with the description given here of the voice they heard. The voice was not harsh, it was not loud, and although it was a small voice, it had a powerful piercing effect on them. This voice was not only heard with their ears, but it spoke to their hearts.’ I watched the Sniders as they listened intently to my companion. “After some discussion about prayer and listening to the Spirit, it was Brother Snider’s turn to read: ‘And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them: Behold my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.’ Brother Snider paused, looking intently at his Book of Mormon. Then he looked up at me and said, ‘Heavenly Father was really proud of His Son, wasn’t He?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. Brother Snider looked back at his book again and stared at the open pages as if deep in thought. Finally he said, ‘I would want Heavenly Father to be proud of me too. I wonder how He would introduce me. I guess, if I . . . well, if I want Him to be proud of me then I had better do what He wants me to do.’ ‘Yes, I think that would be important,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ Brother Snider continued. ‘I think I’ve been worrying too much about what everybody else thinks and not enough about what God thinks.’ After a brief pause Brother Snider nodded and with a determined look said, ‘I think I had better be baptized.’ His response was so unexpected that my companion and I looked at him with blank stares. Finally, my companion said, ‘Yes, that would be the right thing to do. In fact, later on in this chapter the Savior teaches . . .’ As my companion talked I felt a burning in my heart and gratitude for the power']","The context illustrates that reading and praying about the Book of Mormon can lead individuals to receive a spiritual witness of its truthfulness, supporting its status as the Word of God. For example, the story of Brother Snider shows how reading 3 Nephi 11 and listening to the Spirit helped him recognize the Savior’s voice and feel Heavenly Father’s pride, which inspired him to decide to be baptized. This personal spiritual witness aligns with the theme that the Book of Mormon is the Word of God and that testimony and spiritual witness are vital in confirming its divine origin.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does the spirit influence the restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith and help people keep commitments like reading the Book of Mormon and praying to know it's true, especially when they are changing their lives and receiving blessings from keeping commandments?","['<1-hop>\n\n**Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel. Previous dispensations have ended in apostasy (see D&C 136:36–38). – Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets all taught the gospel (see Moses 5:4–12). - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement – The Son of God restored and taught the gospel. He performed many miracles (see Bible Dictionary, “Miracles,” 732–33). – He called Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to preach the gospel and perform saving ordinances such as baptism (see John 15:16). – Christ established His Church. – Christ was crucified, and His Apostles were rejected and killed (see Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:25). – Christ accomplished the Atonement (see Bible Dictionary, “Atonement,” 617). - The Great Apostasy – Without revelation through a prophet, people fall into spiritual darkness (see Amos 8:11–12). – Prophets and Apostles foretold the Great Apostasy (see 2 Thessalonians 2:1–3). - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith – Joseph sought for truth (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10). – God and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17). – Like prophets in earlier dispensations, Joseph Smith was called as the prophet of this last dispensation. – God restored the fulness of the gospel through Joseph Smith (see D&C 35:17; 135:3). – Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Christ’s Church was organized (see D&C 13; 27:12). – A living prophet directs the Church today. - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ – The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. – Joseph translated the plates by the power of God (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraph 5). – The Book of Mormon proves that God inspires prophets in our day as He has in every dispensation (see D&C 20:5–12). – The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 20:8–9). - Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost – You can know that the Book of Mormon is true (see Moroni 10:3–5; Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 1, 8–9). – The Holy Ghost will teach you through your thoughts and feelings (see D&C 8:2–3). **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. #### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 58) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - If there were a prophet on the earth today, what would you ask him? - Do you believe that God hears your prayers?

This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital. There may be times when you call the investigators to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment. Help investigators identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message. Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments. Investigators are changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are with them. Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 215) - Write in your daily planner your plans for daily contact with each investigator. Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with investigators. - Choose one commitment invitation you will extend when you teach the lessons. Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment. Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns. #### Remember This (Page 215) - Focus on inviting people to make commitments in every finding or teaching situation, both with those who are not members of the Church and with Church members. - Extend commitment invitations to help people experience conversion. - Promise blessings. - Bear testimony. - Follow through to help people keep commitments. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 216) ### Personal Study (Page 216) - Identify a commandment listed in either lesson 4 or 5. Think of the blessings you have received from obeying this commandment, and write them in your journal. - In a letter, ask your family members how they have been blessed by obeying a specific commandment (for example, tithing). - Write how you feel about extending commitments. Are you bold or timid? Are you confident that people will be blessed, or do you have doubts? Are you consistent, patient, and helpful as you make daily contact? Do the people know you love them? How can you correct any weakness you identify in your invitations? - Review your lesson plans for each lesson. Do you include specific commitments? Does your lesson plan lead clearly to commitments? ### Companion Study (Page 216) - From your daily planner, make a list of people you have contacted in the past two days, including investigators and members. For each person, write the commitment(s) they made and other invitations you could have or should have extended. Discuss why you were able to obtain commitments from some of these people and what prevented you from obtaining commitments from others. What will you do to follow up on these commitments? - Look at your daily planner, and write the names of specific investigators you will teach in the next day or two. Consider which commandment(s) listed in lessons 4 and 5 you will invite them to live. Discuss how you will extend the commitment and the specific blessings you will promise for obedience. - Consider showing the Teaching Record to investigators to let them know what will be expected. If appropriate, share a copy with them. - Review the Notes/To Do List in your planner for the past three days to see if you have written your assignments to follow up on every invitation you have extended. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 216) - Discuss effective and creative ideas for daily contact with investigators. How have missionaries worked with members effectively? What printed or audiovisual materials are useful? What can you do when people are not home or are too busy to see you? - Discuss ways that missionaries have effectively taught the commandments in lessons 4 and 5. - Discuss specific concerns of some current investigators. What are the nature of these concerns? What can the missionaries do to resolve the concerns? ### Mission President (Page 216) - Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach. Help them focus on helping people make and keep commitments. - Encourage priesthood leaders and members to actively participate in making daily contact with investigators. - Be an example of extending invitations in your missionary efforts and with the missionaries you serve. > Beginning of chapter 12 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation? (Page 217) #### Consider This (Page 217) - What do I need to do to help prepare people for baptism and confirmation? - How do I conduct an effective baptismal interview? - How is a spiritual baptismal service planned and conducted? - How do I work closely with the bishop to ensure that converts are confirmed? - Why is it important to complete baptismal and confirmation records? ## Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 217) The purpose of your teaching is to help others develop faith in Jesus Christ and repent of their sins. As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (Moroni 8:25). The baptismal interview is the way established by the Church to ensure that each candidate meets the Lord’s standards for baptism and is prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Through this interview, baptismal candidates fulfill the scriptural requirement that they witness before an authorized representative of the Church that they have “truly repented of all their sins” (D&C 20:37). The commitments that investigators make prepare them to make and keep the covenant of baptism. People who have kept the commitments that you invited them to make will be well prepared for the interview and for membership and activity in the Church. As you teach investigators and prepare them for baptism and confirmation, make sure that they meet the qualifications for baptism. #### Qualifications for Baptism (Page 218) 1. **Doctrine and Covenants 20:37:**']","The influence of the Spirit is vital in the restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith, as it testifies of the truthfulness of the message and helps individuals recognize the divine origin of the Book of Mormon and the prophet Joseph Smith. When people read the Book of Mormon and pray with sincere hearts, the Spirit testifies to them that it is true, supporting their spiritual growth and commitment. As investigators and members keep commandments and follow the Spirit's promptings, they experience blessings and are changed, gaining confidence in their faith and understanding of the gospel. The Spirit's sustaining influence encourages them to continue their spiritual journey, helping them succeed in their commitments and receive the blessings associated with obedience and faith.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How can personal revelation and spiritual confirmation help us feel the Spirit of the Lord in strengthening faith when we pray about the Book of Mormon's truth?,"['<1-hop>\n\nand pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost']","According to the context, reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are essential steps toward experiencing personal revelation and spiritual confirmation. When we sincerely pray to know the truth through the Holy Ghost, He teaches us through gentle feelings and thoughts, helping us feel the Spirit of the Lord. This spiritual confirmation strengthens our faith by affirming that the message of the Restoration is true and that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet. Therefore, engaging in prayer and seeking the Spirit's guidance can lead us to a deeper spiritual conviction and reinforce our faith in the gospel.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does the Holy Ghost help missionaries in companion exchanges and teaching, and why is it important to work with your companion and the Spirit to teach families and individuals outside your area?","['<1-hop>\n\nshould be able to see and hear your companion at all times unless you are in the bathroom, in an interview with a mission leader, or conducting a baptismal interview (see 2.3.6). You should sleep in the same room but not the same bed. When doing individual tasks while in your housing, use common sense to protect yourselves and follow missionary standards of behavior (see 3.0). Do not create time to be alone. For example, do not stay up later or get up earlier than your companion. If you and your companion become separated, contact your mission president immediately. > 2.2.3 ### Working in Your Area “Go and labor with [your] mights” (Jacob 5:72), and concentrate your efforts in your assigned teaching area. Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88). You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2). If you need to leave your area for another reason, request permission from your district leader to leave your area within your district or from your zone leaders if you need to travel outside of your district. You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone. If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders. - In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer. - District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district. - Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone. - Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones. - Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president. - A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should: - Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate. - Plan the companion exchange in advance. - Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping. - Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel. - Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching. - Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve. - Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement. - Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange. - Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president. > 2.3.2 ### Transfers The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office. - If your companion is transferred and you are', '<2-hop>\n\nactivities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ## The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power? Study Alma 17:2–3, D&C 53:3, 1 Corinthians 2:4 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 19) Look at the painting of Christ ordaining the Apostles, and then read John 15:1–16. - In what way is Christ the vine? How are you a branch of that vine? How does your setting apart relate to this relationship? - Read again your ministerial certificate. Record your feelings and thoughts about what you read. Each time you study this chapter, repeat this process. Note how your feelings change over time. - Study Doctrine and Covenants 109:13–15, 21–30, 38–39, 55–57, which are excerpts from the Prophet Joseph Smith’s inspired dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple. What blessings did Joseph Smith request for the faithful? ## The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 19) The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work. The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will,']","The Holy Ghost plays a crucial role in missionary work by teaching and testifying of the truth, guiding missionaries to speak words in the moment they need them, and helping them discern the needs of those they teach. During companion exchanges, leaders and missionaries rely on the Spirit to strengthen each other, set goals, and give helpful feedback. Working with your companion and the Spirit is important because it enables missionaries to teach by divine power, especially when teaching families and individuals outside their area, ensuring that their message is effective and inspired by the Holy Ghost, which is essential for helping others come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

These approved resources can strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach.

If you are a new missionary, study with your trainer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes each day for the first 12 weeks in the mission field (see “For New Missionaries: Additional Companion Study” in “Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel?” in Preach My Gospel). > 2.4.5 ### Meals with Others If applicable, your mission president and the local stake president will provide guidelines for scheduling meals with people in your mission. When members or others provide meals: - Be respectful of their personal situations and time. - Be grateful for the food they offer. - Ask to teach a 15- or 20-minute lesson before or after the meal to strengthen those you visit and to provide you with an opportunity to improve your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Another adult of your own gender should be present with you and your companion when you eat a meal with someone of the opposite gender. > 2.5 ## Preparation Day Your mission president will assign one day each week as a preparation day. Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing. If you have a teaching appointment, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | > 2.6 ## Sabbath Day Activities Plan activities on the Sabbath that help you fulfill your missionary purpose to find, teach, baptize, and help others learn about and become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). You', '<2-hop>\n\n#### Activity: Companion Study (Page 191) With your companion, practice different ways to begin a lesson using several of these suggestions. ## Adjust Your Teaching to Meet Needs (Page 191) Each person or family you teach is unique. Even though you will not understand all of their interests, achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to their circumstances. Regardless of needs or problems, all people are best helped as they accept and live the gospel. You will be able to adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the Spirit. You may alter the order of the lessons as you are inspired to adapt to the investigators’ interests and needs. You may use more than one meeting to teach the principles in one lesson, and occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons in a single meeting. Heavenly Father knows His children, so rely on inspiration to make these decisions as you teach. Pray for the gift of discernment, and pay attention to thoughts that come to your mind or feelings you have about what to teach. You will need to adjust your teaching to give more attention to those commitments that are more difficult for an investigator to keep. For example, one person may easily accept the Book of Mormon as the word of God, while another may struggle to accept anything but the Bible. One person may have trouble giving up tobacco but will readily accept the law of tithing. As you plan when to teach certain doctrines, be sensitive about how much new information you share. Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the investigators. Some will progress faster or slower than others. Make sure that you ask enough questions and listen carefully to their answers so you have a firm understanding of how quickly and how well the investigator is learning and applying the doctrines you are presenting. Be sensitive to time. Most teaching appointments should not last beyond 45 minutes. A teaching visit can be completed, however, in 15 or 20 minutes if needed. If the person has only 15 minutes to meet with you, adjust your teaching to respect that limitation. Trust in the promise that the Spirit will give you “in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say” (D&C 100:6). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 192) Imagine that you are walking down the street and notice an older man struggling to place some heavy bags into a garbage can. You and your companion help him, and as a result he asks who you are. After some discussion he invites you into his home and agrees to hear your message. During the initial conversation he tells you that: - His wife died a year ago, and he really misses her. - He tires easily because of a heart condition. - He wonders more now than ever before whether God exists. What might you teach him? How could you adjust your teaching to best meet his needs and concerns? #### Scripture Study (page 192) - What does it mean to give “that portion that shall be meted unto every man”? - Alma 29:8, D&C 84:85 - What has the Lord promised faithful missionaries? - D&C 68:2–4, D&C 100:5–8, Matthew 10:19–20 ## Teach with Your Companion in Unity (Page 192) The Lord has commanded, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” (D&C 42:6). Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work together in unity. As you plan and study each day, discuss how you will teach so that you can be united and teach with one voice. Your teaching will be more powerful if you and your companion alternate giving brief portions of the lesson. Avoid falling into a routine when presenting the message. Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths of which he or she has testified. Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something. As companions, be ready to yield to each other so that you do not hinder the guidance of the Spirit. When you speak, maintain eye contact with the investigator. When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the investigator’s responses. #### Scripture Study (Page 193) - How do companions support one another? - Alma 12:1, D&C 42:6, D&C 52:9–10 ## Invite Members to Help You Teach (Page 193) Whenever possible invite members, preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the investigators. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of missionary work. It also provides friendship for the investigator. President Thomas S. Monson taught: *During the teaching process investigators can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new investigators so that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps the second or third visit. Can you appreciate, for example, when missionaries are working with those from the United Church of Canada, the strength of']","The context emphasizes that daily activities should focus on interacting with people, including serving others and building relationships, which aligns with the themes of community service and discipleship. For example, helping an older man with his heavy bags demonstrates personal service that fosters trust and understanding. Additionally, inviting members to help teach and sharing personal experiences can strengthen relationships and demonstrate genuine care. By engaging in such acts of service, missionaries can develop trust and rapport with individuals and communities, thereby effectively building relationships and discipleship as part of their spiritual and service-oriented efforts.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does the influence of the Spirit support the restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith, as described in the context?","['<1-hop>\n\n**Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel. Previous dispensations have ended in apostasy (see D&C 136:36–38). – Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets all taught the gospel (see Moses 5:4–12). - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement – The Son of God restored and taught the gospel. He performed many miracles (see Bible Dictionary, “Miracles,” 732–33). – He called Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to preach the gospel and perform saving ordinances such as baptism (see John 15:16). – Christ established His Church. – Christ was crucified, and His Apostles were rejected and killed (see Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:25). – Christ accomplished the Atonement (see Bible Dictionary, “Atonement,” 617). - The Great Apostasy – Without revelation through a prophet, people fall into spiritual darkness (see Amos 8:11–12). – Prophets and Apostles foretold the Great Apostasy (see 2 Thessalonians 2:1–3). - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith – Joseph sought for truth (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10). – God and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17). – Like prophets in earlier dispensations, Joseph Smith was called as the prophet of this last dispensation. – God restored the fulness of the gospel through Joseph Smith (see D&C 35:17; 135:3). – Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Christ’s Church was organized (see D&C 13; 27:12). – A living prophet directs the Church today. - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ – The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. – Joseph translated the plates by the power of God (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraph 5). – The Book of Mormon proves that God inspires prophets in our day as He has in every dispensation (see D&C 20:5–12). – The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 20:8–9). - Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost – You can know that the Book of Mormon is true (see Moroni 10:3–5; Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 1, 8–9). – The Holy Ghost will teach you through your thoughts and feelings (see D&C 8:2–3). **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. #### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 58) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - If there were a prophet on the earth today, what would you ask him? - Do you believe that God hears your prayers?

This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital. There may be times when you call the investigators to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment. Help investigators identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message. Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments. Investigators are changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are with them. Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 215) - Write in your daily planner your plans for daily contact with each investigator. Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with investigators. - Choose one commitment invitation you will extend when you teach the lessons. Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment. Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns. #### Remember This (Page 215) - Focus on inviting people to make commitments in every finding or teaching situation, both with those who are not members of the Church and with Church members. - Extend commitment invitations to help people experience conversion. - Promise blessings. - Bear testimony. - Follow through to help people keep commitments. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 216) ### Personal Study (Page 216) - Identify a commandment listed in either lesson 4 or 5. Think of the blessings you have received from obeying this commandment, and write them in your journal. - In a letter, ask your family members how they have been blessed by obeying a specific commandment (for example, tithing). - Write how you feel about extending commitments. Are you bold or timid? Are you confident that people will be blessed, or do you have doubts? Are you consistent, patient, and helpful as you make daily contact? Do the people know you love them? How can you correct any weakness you identify in your invitations? - Review your lesson plans for each lesson. Do you include specific commitments? Does your lesson plan lead clearly to commitments? ### Companion Study (Page 216) - From your daily planner, make a list of people you have contacted in the past two days, including investigators and members. For each person, write the commitment(s) they made and other invitations you could have or should have extended. Discuss why you were able to obtain commitments from some of these people and what prevented you from obtaining commitments from others. What will you do to follow up on these commitments? - Look at your daily planner, and write the names of specific investigators you will teach in the next day or two. Consider which commandment(s) listed in lessons 4 and 5 you will invite them to live. Discuss how you will extend the commitment and the specific blessings you will promise for obedience. - Consider showing the Teaching Record to investigators to let them know what will be expected. If appropriate, share a copy with them. - Review the Notes/To Do List in your planner for the past three days to see if you have written your assignments to follow up on every invitation you have extended. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 216) - Discuss effective and creative ideas for daily contact with investigators. How have missionaries worked with members effectively? What printed or audiovisual materials are useful? What can you do when people are not home or are too busy to see you? - Discuss ways that missionaries have effectively taught the commandments in lessons 4 and 5. - Discuss specific concerns of some current investigators. What are the nature of these concerns? What can the missionaries do to resolve the concerns? ### Mission President (Page 216) - Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach. Help them focus on helping people make and keep commitments. - Encourage priesthood leaders and members to actively participate in making daily contact with investigators. - Be an example of extending invitations in your missionary efforts and with the missionaries you serve. > Beginning of chapter 12 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation? (Page 217) #### Consider This (Page 217) - What do I need to do to help prepare people for baptism and confirmation? - How do I conduct an effective baptismal interview? - How is a spiritual baptismal service planned and conducted? - How do I work closely with the bishop to ensure that converts are confirmed? - Why is it important to complete baptismal and confirmation records? ## Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 217) The purpose of your teaching is to help others develop faith in Jesus Christ and repent of their sins. As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (Moroni 8:25). The baptismal interview is the way established by the Church to ensure that each candidate meets the Lord’s standards for baptism and is prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Through this interview, baptismal candidates fulfill the scriptural requirement that they witness before an authorized representative of the Church that they have “truly repented of all their sins” (D&C 20:37). The commitments that investigators make prepare them to make and keep the covenant of baptism. People who have kept the commitments that you invited them to make will be well prepared for the interview and for membership and activity in the Church. As you teach investigators and prepare them for baptism and confirmation, make sure that they meet the qualifications for baptism. #### Qualifications for Baptism (Page 218) 1. **Doctrine and Covenants 20:37:**']","The context explains that the restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith is supported by the influence of the Spirit, which is vital in helping individuals recognize the truthfulness of the message. The Spirit testifies of the truth as people read, ponder, and pray about the Book of Mormon and the teachings of Joseph Smith. This divine influence encourages investigators to keep commitments, experience spiritual blessings, and ultimately accept the restored gospel, demonstrating how the Spirit's sustaining influence is essential in guiding individuals to recognize the truth of the gospel through Joseph Smith.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How can personal revelation and spiritual confirmation help missionaries strengthen faith through the Spirit of the Lord, especially when praying about the Book of Mormon?","['<1-hop>\n\nand pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost']","Missionaries can strengthen faith by using personal revelation and spiritual confirmation through prayer and pondering the Book of Mormon.

There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Use it as your main source for teaching restored truth. > Remember This - The Book of Mormon is the keystone of our witness of Christ, our doctrine, and our testimonies. - The Book of Mormon teaches plainly the doctrine found in the missionary lessons. - Use the Book of Mormon to answer the questions of the soul and to respond to objections to the Church. - Read consistently from the Book of Mormon with your investigators and new converts. Do all you can to help them read on their own every day and apply what they learn in their lives. - Trust the Lord’s promise that every person who sincerely reads and prays about the Book of Mormon will know of its truthfulness by the power of the Holy Ghost. Restoration. Refer them to “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ” lesson if needed. - Emphasize the importance of keeping the length of the message appropriate to the setting. For example, missionaries might spend more time teaching in a member’s home than they would teaching someone in the store. - Allow as many missionaries as time permits to teach the message of the Restoration in their assigned situation. - Teach the principles found in the “Teach When You Find, Find When You Teach” section. - Assign each missionary to prepare a one-minute message he or she could share in a finding setting. These messages should be based on the doctrine found in the missionary lessons. - Invite the missionaries to practice sharing their one-minute message with each other. You may want to set up a variety of finding settings, such as teaching in a member’s home, teaching on a doorstep, teaching on a sidewalk, or contacting a referral. Have the missionaries practice teaching in each of these settings.']","Missionaries can effectively use teaching principles and methods from Preach My Gospel by studying the doctrines and principles outlined in its chapters, which are designed to strengthen their gospel knowledge and teaching skills. Specifically, they should focus on chapters that emphasize recognizing and understanding the Spirit, the role of the Book of Mormon, and effective study techniques. The training materials highlight the importance of using scriptures, such as the Book of Mormon, as a primary resource for teaching restored truth, answering investigators' questions, and helping new converts read and apply the scriptures daily. By applying these principles—such as teaching when you find and finding when you teach—and incorporating study resources into their daily routines, missionaries can deepen their spiritual development and improve their ability to teach effectively, fulfilling their purpose to help others come unto Christ.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost', ""<2-hop>\n\nchapter. - Over the course of several weeks, review the Savior’s teachings in the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and 3 Nephi. In your study journal, make a list of the questions He asked. Compare these questions with the questions you typically ask. Read the account of Ammon and King Lamoni in Aima 18 and the account of Aaron in Alma 22:4-18. As you read, identify and describe how Ammon and Aaron: - Followed the Spirit and taught with love. - Began to teach - Adapted their teachings to meet needs. - Bore testimony. - Used the scriptures. - Asked questions, listened, and resolved concerns. - Encouraged those they taught to make commitments. - Ponder the following statements by President Harold B. Lee regarding teaching for understanding. Evaluate how clearly you teach the doctrines of the gospel. Record what you learn in your study journal. “May you stay with the context of the scripture and reduce it to understandable terms” (The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, sel. Clyde J. Williams [1996], 444). “Now you as teachers are not being sent out to teach new doctrine. You're to teach the old doctrines, not so plain that they can just understand, but you must teach the doctrines of the Church so plainly that no one can misunderstand” (The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, 458). ### Companion Study (Page 208) - Review your lesson plan from a recent lesson you have taught. Write one question for each of the major principles outlined in your plan. Then review your questions to see whether they are in harmony with what is taught in this chapter. Next, answer each question as though you were an investigator. Revise your questions as needed. Share your questions with your companion. Together, evaluate your questions. Consider the needs of an investigator you are teaching. Discuss how he or she might answer your questions. Also discuss how these questions may invite the Spirit and help the investigator learn the gospel. - Think of each of your new investigators. Discuss what you can do to help them become a progressing investigator. Write your ideas in your study journal and make plans in your daily planner. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 208) - Invite members or current investigators to your meeting. Explain to the group that you want missionaries to improve their ability to share their important message. Select a lesson and a skill. Have the missionaries teach the members or investigators the lesson you have selected for 20 minutes, focusing on the skill you have identified. Have them switch after 20 minutes. After the missionaries have had an opportunity to teach, bring the group together and have the members and investi- gators tell the missionaries what was most effective and one way they can improve. - Show video examples of missionaries teaching or contacting people. Select a skill and discuss as a group how well the missionaries in the video applied the principles for that skill. - Select a skill or an important aspect of a skill, and identify doctrine or scripture passages that support the skill. Teach the doctrinal foundation of the skill to the missionaries. ### Mission President (Page 208) - Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach. Plan with them how you can participate in the teaching. - Encourage priesthood leaders to accompany missionaries in their teaching visits and provide feedback. - Demonstrate the effective use of scriptures, questions, and listening when teaching missionaries in zone conferences and interviews. > Beginning of chapter 11 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Help People Make and Keep Commitments? (Page 209) #### Consider This (Page 209) - Why should I focus on inviting people to make commitments? - How do commitments relate to conversion? - How can I bear humble testimony? - What blessings can I promise? - Why is it important for me to follow up when people make commitments? ## Extend Commitment Invitations (Page 209) As a missionary you desire the salvation of souls (see Mosiah 28:3). You know that people can come unto Christ and be saved only on conditions of repentance (see D&C 18:10–16). One way to fulfill your desires is to cry repentance (see Alma 5:49; D&C 15:6; 16:6) and boldly invite people to exercise faith unto repentance, to be baptized by water and the Spirit, and to endure faithfully to the end (see 3 Nephi 27:16–20; Mormon 7:10). Commitment is an essential part of repentance. It is the act of obligating oneself to a course of action and then diligently following through on that decision. When people are genuinely committed, they have real intent, meaning that they fully intend to do what they have committed to do. They make an unwavering and earnest decision to change. They become devoted to Christ and dedicate themselves to His gospel. Keeping their commitment is how they “truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins” (D&C 20:37). When you ask for commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting the investigator to repent. One of the best ways to help people make and keep commitments is to extend a commitment invitation. Extending and following up on commitment invitations is vital because: - People become converted as they live the principles they learn (see John 7:17) and feel the Spirit confirm that what they are doing is pleasing to their Father in Heaven. - Repentance and change will help people conquer challenges, rid themselves of shame and guilt, and experience the peace and joy of God’s forgiveness. - Keeping commitments prepares people to make and keep sacred covenants. You can show your love for the people and your faith in God’s promises by following up to help them repent and keep their commitments. The commitments required for baptism are listed in the first four lessons. The commitments related to spiritual progress after baptism and confirmation are listed in lesson 5.""]","Effective teaching principles involve asking questions to engage investigators and assess their understanding, listening carefully to their concerns, and resolving doubts through scripture and personal testimony. For example, when introducing the Book of Mormon, you can ask questions like, ""What do you feel about the message of this book?"" and listen to their responses. By showing how the Book of Mormon confirms the truth of the Restoration and guiding them to pray sincerely to know its truth through the Holy Ghost, you help them gain a personal witness. Teaching with love, adapting your message to meet their needs, and encouraging commitments—such as reading the Book of Mormon and praying—are essential. These methods align with the themes of teaching principles and methods for sharing the gospel, ensuring that investigators not only understand the doctrines but also feel motivated and confident to act on their beliefs, leading to spiritual progress and commitment.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

He is a member of a mission presidency with two counselors. Counselors in the mission presidency, like counselors in a stake presidency or bishopric, help organize and assist in the work. Counselors in the mission presidency do not address matters of missionary worthiness. > 2.1.3 ### Mission Leadership Organization Your mission president uses revelation and priesthood keys to organize the work. He assigns young missionaries to be trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants. Assistants, office missionaries, and other missionaries do not make missionary leadership assignments or assign the areas where you serve. However, the mission president may counsel with his wife or his assistants about missionary assignments. Your mission leaders and the assistants, zone leaders, and sister training leaders are members of the mission leadership council. These leaders counsel about meeting the needs of the missionaries and make plans to help the mission progress and to move the work forward. > 2.1.4 ### Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities Young missionary leaders, like all missionaries, follow the counsel of Jesus Christ to “serve [God] with all [their] heart, might, mind and strength” and to “remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence” (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2, 6). Leadership assignments do not indicate special recognition or advancement or reflect the worth of a missionary. Young missionary leaders have the responsibility to: - Find, teach, baptize, and fellowship people. - Set an example of missionary standards for behavior (see 3.0). - Train other missionaries and lead companion exchanges (see 2.3.1). - Share information and direction from the mission leadership council with the missionaries they lead. - Love and befriend other missionaries. Help them recognize the value of their efforts. - Listen to other missionaries’ concerns. Give support and counsel. - Correct other missionaries kindly and privately, as needed, followed by “an increase of love” (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–43). - Work closely with local leaders and members. Like all missionaries, elders and sisters with leadership assignments should practice Christlike leadership. If the conduct of any missionary, including young missionary leaders, seems inconsistent with the commandments and missionary standards, discuss the issue with the missionary. If the issue is not then resolved, share your concerns with your young missionary leaders or mission president and not with other missionaries, members, or friends. For more information about the specific assignments and responsibilities of young missionary leaders (trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants to the president), see section 7.1, “Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities.” > 2.1.5 ### Personal Responsibilities “Magnify [your] office unto the Lord” (Jacob 1:19), become spiritually self-reliant, and “act for [yourself]” (2 Nephi 2:16) by trusting the Lord and following the Spirit. When you have questions or concerns: Apply the teaching to “study it out in your mind; then … ask me if it be right” (Doctrine and Covenants 9:8). Seek guidance through personal revelation; prayer; and study of the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets, and these standards. If you need additional help after applying these principles, ask your companion or young missionary leaders. Often, they can help you find answers to your questions and resolve your concerns. If not, reach out to either of your mission leaders, your parents, or your home priesthood leaders. Please do not contact Church headquarters. If you do, you will be referred back to your mission president. Talk with your mission president about worthiness issues. Talk with either of your mission leaders about immediate safety concerns, including assault or abuse, or other issues that cannot be resolved with other missionaries. There may be times during your mission when you find it difficult to focus on your work due to current challenges, personal or family matters, or even past experiences. That is understandable. Do not hesitate to share your concerns with your companion, young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders and to reach out for support. Remember the Savior’s invitation: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen” (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36–37). > 2.2 ## Companions The Lord calls missionaries to preach His gospel in companionships. “Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands” (Doctrine and Covenants 52:10). You will work with different companions throughout your mission. Companions: Become united in the work and together testify of Jesus Christ. Support each other’s spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. Try to keep each other safe. Are accountable to each other in keeping missionary standards. > 2.2.1 ### Supporting Each Other Companions should help each other learn, grow, and develop Christlike attributes (see Doctrine and Covenants 4 and “How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 6). Learning patience and love, practicing forgiveness, and accepting differences in personalities will bless you throughout your life. As companions: - Love, respect, and strengthen each other. - Study together every day and pray together frequently throughout the day. - Be humble and recognize each other’s strengths. - Treat each other as you would like to be treated. - Avoid criticism and contention. - Avoid speaking negatively about each other to other missionaries, Church members, or family and friends at home. If you notice any inappropriate situation or behavior, discuss it with your companion.

There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes),', '<3-hop>\n\nNephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away', '<4-hop>\n\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven. - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - Faith in Jesus Christ - Repentance - Baptism, Our First Covenant - The Gift of the Holy Ghost - Endure to the End **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

The Atonement satisfies the demands of justice, allowing mercy to be extended to those who repent and strive to keep His commandments. Understanding these principles helps missionaries recognize that developing Christlike attributes—such as faith, patience, love, and humility—is essential in becoming more like Christ and preparing for judgment. By applying the teachings of the Atonement and Resurrection, missionaries can strengthen their own spiritual development and better support others in their journey of faith, repentance, and obedience, ultimately helping them to become more Christlike and prepared to meet their Heavenly Father.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission', '<2-hop>\n\nwith priesthood keys. He is a member of a mission presidency with two counselors. Counselors in the mission presidency, like counselors in a stake presidency or bishopric, help organize and assist in the work. Counselors in the mission presidency do not address matters of missionary worthiness. > 2.1.3 ### Mission Leadership Organization Your mission president uses revelation and priesthood keys to organize the work. He assigns young missionaries to be trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants. Assistants, office missionaries, and other missionaries do not make missionary leadership assignments or assign the areas where you serve. However, the mission president may counsel with his wife or his assistants about missionary assignments. Your mission leaders and the assistants, zone leaders, and sister training leaders are members of the mission leadership council. These leaders counsel about meeting the needs of the missionaries and make plans to help the mission progress and to move the work forward. > 2.1.4 ### Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities Young missionary leaders, like all missionaries, follow the counsel of Jesus Christ to “serve [God] with all [their] heart, might, mind and strength” and to “remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence” (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2, 6). Leadership assignments do not indicate special recognition or advancement or reflect the worth of a missionary. Young missionary leaders have the responsibility to: - Find, teach, baptize, and fellowship people. - Set an example of missionary standards for behavior (see 3.0). - Train other missionaries and lead companion exchanges (see 2.3.1). - Share information and direction from the mission leadership council with the missionaries they lead. - Love and befriend other missionaries. Help them recognize the value of their efforts. - Listen to other missionaries’ concerns. Give support and counsel. - Correct other missionaries kindly and privately, as needed, followed by “an increase of love” (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–43). - Work closely with local leaders and members. Like all missionaries, elders and sisters with leadership assignments should practice Christlike leadership. If the conduct of any missionary, including young missionary leaders, seems inconsistent with the commandments and missionary standards, discuss the issue with the missionary. If the issue is not then resolved, share your concerns with your young missionary leaders or mission president and not with other missionaries, members, or friends. For more information about the specific assignments and responsibilities of young missionary leaders (trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants to the president), see section 7.1, “Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities.” > 2.1.5 ### Personal Responsibilities “Magnify [your] office unto the Lord” (Jacob 1:19), become spiritually self-reliant, and “act for [yourself]” (2 Nephi 2:16) by trusting the Lord and following the Spirit. When you have questions or concerns: Apply the teaching to “study it out in your mind; then … ask me if it be right” (Doctrine and Covenants 9:8). Seek guidance through personal revelation; prayer; and study of the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets, and these standards. If you need additional help after applying these principles, ask your companion or young missionary leaders. Often, they can help you find answers to your questions and resolve your concerns. If not, reach out to either of your mission leaders, your parents, or your home priesthood leaders. Please do not contact Church headquarters. If you do, you will be referred back to your mission president. Talk with your mission president about worthiness issues. Talk with either of your mission leaders about immediate safety concerns, including assault or abuse, or other issues that cannot be resolved with other missionaries. There may be times during your mission when you find it difficult to focus on your work due to current challenges, personal or family matters, or even past experiences. That is understandable. Do not hesitate to share your concerns with your companion, young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders and to reach out for support. Remember the Savior’s invitation: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen” (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36–37). > 2.2 ## Companions The Lord calls missionaries to preach His gospel in companionships. “Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands” (Doctrine and Covenants 52:10). You will work with different companions throughout your mission. Companions: Become united in the work and together testify of Jesus Christ. Support each other’s spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. Try to keep each other safe. Are accountable to each other in keeping missionary standards. > 2.2.1 ### Supporting Each Other Companions should help each other learn, grow, and develop Christlike attributes (see Doctrine and Covenants 4 and “How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 6). Learning patience and love, practicing forgiveness, and accepting differences in personalities will bless you throughout your life. As companions: - Love, respect, and strengthen each other. - Study together every day and pray together frequently throughout the day. - Be humble and recognize each other’s strengths. - Treat each other as you would like to be treated. - Avoid criticism and contention. - Avoid speaking negatively about each other to other missionaries, Church members, or family and friends at home. If you notice any inappropriate situation or behavior, discuss it with your companion. If the matter is not resolved or if your companion is being abusive, have the courage and love for your companion to ask your mission president for help (see 3.9.2). > 2.2.2 ### Staying Together Staying with your companion will help provide protection from physical and spiritual dangers, false accusations, and loneliness. Obey this missionary standard at all times and in all places. Never be alone.

If not, reach out to either of your mission leaders, your parents, or your home priesthood leaders. Please do not contact Church headquarters. If you do, you will be referred back to your mission president. Talk with your mission president about worthiness issues. Talk with either of your mission leaders about immediate safety concerns, including assault or abuse, or other issues that cannot be resolved with other missionaries. There may be times during your mission when you find it difficult to focus on your work due to current challenges, personal or family matters, or even past experiences. That is understandable. Do not hesitate to share your concerns with your companion, young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders and to reach out for support. Remember the Savior’s invitation: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen” (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36–37). > 2.2 ## Companions The Lord calls missionaries to preach His gospel in companionships. “Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands” (Doctrine and Covenants 52:10). You will work with different companions throughout your mission. Companions: Become united in the work and together testify of Jesus Christ. Support each other’s spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. Try to keep each other safe. Are accountable to each other in keeping missionary standards. > 2.2.1 ### Supporting Each Other Companions should help each other learn, grow, and develop Christlike attributes (see Doctrine and Covenants 4 and “How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 6). Learning patience and love, practicing forgiveness, and accepting differences in personalities will bless you throughout your life. As companions: - Love, respect, and strengthen each other. - Study together every day and pray together frequently throughout the day. - Be humble and recognize each other’s strengths. - Treat each other as you would like to be treated. - Avoid criticism and contention. - Avoid speaking negatively about each other to other missionaries, Church members, or family and friends at home. If you notice any inappropriate situation or behavior, discuss it with your companion. If the matter is not resolved or if your companion is being abusive, have the courage and love for your companion to ask your mission president for help (see 3.9.2). > 2.2.2 ### Staying Together Staying with your companion will help provide protection from physical and spiritual dangers, false accusations, and loneliness. Obey this missionary standard at all times and in all places. Never be alone. You', '<2-hop>\n\nshould be able to see and hear your companion at all times unless you are in the bathroom, in an interview with a mission leader, or conducting a baptismal interview (see 2.3.6). You should sleep in the same room but not the same bed. When doing individual tasks while in your housing, use common sense to protect yourselves and follow missionary standards of behavior (see 3.0). Do not create time to be alone. For example, do not stay up later or get up earlier than your companion. If you and your companion become separated, contact your mission president immediately. > 2.2.3 ### Working in Your Area “Go and labor with [your] mights” (Jacob 5:72), and concentrate your efforts in your assigned teaching area. Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88). You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2). If you need to leave your area for another reason, request permission from your district leader to leave your area within your district or from your zone leaders if you need to travel outside of your district. You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone. If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders. - In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer. - District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district. - Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone. - Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones. - Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president. - A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should: - Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate. - Plan the companion exchange in advance. - Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping. - Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel. - Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching. - Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve. - Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement. - Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange. - Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president. > 2.3.2 ### Transfers The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office. - If your companion is transferred and you are', '<3-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with']","The context explains that mission leadership, organized through priesthood keys and the mission presidency, involves assigning roles such as trainers, zone leaders, and young missionary leaders, who are responsible for guiding and supporting other missionaries. Young missionary leaders, like district and zone leaders, have responsibilities that include training, setting an example of missionary standards, and ensuring adherence to Christlike behavior. They are tasked with correcting conduct kindly and privately, and if issues of conduct or standards arise, they are to discuss these with the missionary involved or escalate to mission leaders, emphasizing the importance of missionary conduct and behavior standards. These standards—focused on safety, accountability, and ethical behavior—are integral to the organization of mission leadership, as leaders are responsible for fostering an environment of spiritual safety, integrity, and Christlike conduct among missionaries, aligning with doctrinal standards and the principles outlined in the standards of behavior section.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does the emphasis on the Holy Ghost and personal revelation in the context support the understanding that the Spirit of the Lord strengthens faith, especially in the process of reading and praying about the Book of Mormon as described in the lesson plan?","['<1-hop>\n\n**Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel. Previous dispensations have ended in apostasy (see D&C 136:36–38). – Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets all taught the gospel (see Moses 5:4–12). - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement – The Son of God restored and taught the gospel. He performed many miracles (see Bible Dictionary, “Miracles,” 732–33). – He called Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to preach the gospel and perform saving ordinances such as baptism (see John 15:16). – Christ established His Church. – Christ was crucified, and His Apostles were rejected and killed (see Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:25). – Christ accomplished the Atonement (see Bible Dictionary, “Atonement,” 617). - The Great Apostasy – Without revelation through a prophet, people fall into spiritual darkness (see Amos 8:11–12). – Prophets and Apostles foretold the Great Apostasy (see 2 Thessalonians 2:1–3). - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith – Joseph sought for truth (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10). – God and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17). – Like prophets in earlier dispensations, Joseph Smith was called as the prophet of this last dispensation. – God restored the fulness of the gospel through Joseph Smith (see D&C 35:17; 135:3). – Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Christ’s Church was organized (see D&C 13; 27:12). – A living prophet directs the Church today. - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ – The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. – Joseph translated the plates by the power of God (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraph 5). – The Book of Mormon proves that God inspires prophets in our day as He has in every dispensation (see D&C 20:5–12). – The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 20:8–9). - Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost – You can know that the Book of Mormon is true (see Moroni 10:3–5; Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 1, 8–9). – The Holy Ghost will teach you through your thoughts and feelings (see D&C 8:2–3). **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. #### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 58) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - If there were a prophet on the earth today, what would you ask him? - Do you believe that God hears your prayers? Why? - Would you like to find out that the Book of Mormon is true? Why? ### Key Definitions (page 58) - **Agency:** The ability and privilege God']","The context highlights the importance of reading and praying to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and emphasizes that the Holy Ghost teaches through thoughts and feelings. This directly supports the theme that the Spirit of the Lord strengthens faith by confirming truth through personal revelation. The lesson plan encourages individuals to pray with sincere intent, trusting that the Holy Ghost will testify of the truth, thereby strengthening their faith in the gospel and in the prophet Joseph Smith. This multi-hop connection shows how the Spirit's role in personal revelation is central to building and strengthening faith as taught in the context.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes),', '<2-hop>\n\nand pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost']","The context emphasizes that recognizing and understanding the Spirit is essential for confirming the truth of the Restoration, particularly through studying the Book of Mormon and praying sincerely. The first segment highlights that effective study, prayer, and seeking the Holy Ghost help individuals feel the Spirit's influence, which testifies of truth. The second segment explains that reading the Book of Mormon and praying with real intent allow the Holy Ghost to teach and confirm the message's truthfulness. Together, these themes demonstrate that the Holy Ghost acts as a Testifier of Truth by guiding individuals to recognize the Spirit and feel its witness through sincere study and prayer.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes),', '<2-hop>\n\nfor each key indicator. You may also set goals for your personal development. Do everything within your power to achieve your goals while respecting the agency of others. The ultimate measure of success is not in achieving goals alone but in the service you render and the progress of others. Goals are a means of helping you bring about much good among Heavenly Father’s children. They are not to be used to receive recognition. Carefully considered goals will give you clear direction and will help you fill your days with activities that help people strengthen their faith in the Savior and progress toward baptism, confirmation, and full activity in the Church. Challenging goals will help you work effectively and lead you to stretch and grow. Follow the guidelines below as you set goals: - Follow the Spirit. - Focus on the key indicators. - Focus on people. Although you will use numbers, be able to support your numbers with the names of people where possible. - Be specific and realistic, but set goals that will make you stretch. - Set weekly and daily goals. - Set goals for personal and companion study, including language study if you are learning another language. - Measure your progress each day, each week, and after each six-week period. When you fall short of a goal, evaluate your efforts and seek for ways to accomplish the goal. If needed, adjust your expectations. Over time your mission president may establish standards of excellence or mission goals intended to raise your vision and increase your faith. District, zone, and mission standards will help you stretch, work effectively, and reach higher levels of performance. They are not to be used as quotas that impose specific goals on you and your companion. “I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential. When one learns to master the principles of setting a goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he attains in this life.” – ELDER M. RUSSELL BALLARD TALK GIVEN TO SALT LAKE AREA YOUNG ADULTS, OCT. 18, 1981 #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 161) Set weekly goals for each indicator. For each goal, ask yourselves: - Are there names associated with the number? - Is the goal specific? - Is the goal realistic? - Will the goal make us stretch? - Are we committed to this goal? Discuss each goal. If necessary, determine how you might revise it and why. ## The Weekly Planning Session (Page 161) Once you have set goals, decide how you will achieve them. You and your companion should hold a weekly planning session on a day and at a time that is less productive for proselyting, such as Thursday or Friday morning. Your mission president will set the day and time of the weekly planning session. This weekly planning may take two to three hours to complete. Your discussion should focus on the needs of people and how to help them progress. During this weekly planning session, review past goals and set new goals for the coming week. Consider every aspect of your proselyting. Sunday evening is the recommended time for the weekly call-in report. A Sunday- evening report provides the most accurate and timely status of the mission because most baptisms and confirmations take place on Saturday or Sunday. Because the day you hold your weekly planning session is likely to be different from your reporting day, approach your weekly planning with 10 days in mind. For example, if your weekly planning session is on Thursday, you will review the progress on your goals so far that week, and you will plan what you need to do to achieve these goals through Sunday. Then, set goals and make plans for the next week from Monday to Sunday. On Sunday evening you will total and report the results from the past week, and you will have your plan ready for the coming week. Below is a description of how the planning guidelines apply to a weekly planning session. 1. Pray for and seek inspiration. Before you begin, have your Missionary Daily Planner and area book near. Begin your planning session with prayer. Seek inspiration as you discuss the needs of people and plan how to serve them and help them progress in the gospel. Pray specifically for your investigators. Have the faith to ask Heavenly Father to bless them with answers to their prayers, with a desire to attend church, and so forth. 2. Set goals and make plans for investigators to be baptized and confirmed in the coming week. Review the Teaching Record for each person who is committed to be baptized or confirmed in the coming week. Discuss the arrangements you need to make for baptismal interviews, services, and confirmations. Using the Teaching Record, discuss any commitments these people may be struggling with and how you can help them. Plan to make daily contact with them. Discuss how you can help the ward mission leader coordinate with the bishop for their confirmations in sacrament meeting. 3. Set goals and make plans for investigators with a baptismal date. Review the Teaching Record for each person who will be baptized in the coming weeks. Talk about lessons you need to teach them. Consider how you can help them prepare for baptism and confirmation. Discuss investigators who were not baptized on their scheduled day. Carefully consider and discuss their needs. Set new goals and make plans that will help them progress toward a specific day and time when they can enter into the covenant of baptism and receive the ordinance of confirmation. On your Teaching Record, mark in pencil the principles you plan to teach and the commitments you will help them']","Missionaries can enhance their spiritual preparation and personal development by applying effective time management and scheduling techniques alongside goal setting strategies outlined in Preach My Gospel. The first segment emphasizes the importance of using the mission schedule wisely, including daily personal and companion study, and organizing weekly planning sessions focused on the needs of individuals and their progress. The second segment highlights setting specific, realistic, and challenging goals for personal and companion study, language learning, and proselyting efforts, which help missionaries stay focused and motivated. By praying for inspiration, reviewing progress regularly, and adjusting goals as needed, missionaries can ensure their activities align with their purpose of helping others come unto Christ. Combining these principles allows missionaries to manage their time efficiently, prioritize spiritual and personal growth, and ultimately become more effective in their service and personal development.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How does respecting housing and property relate to demonstrating respect and cultural sensitivity during missionary service?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with', '<2-hop>\n\nis a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders. Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately. For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders.

"How does the Holy Ghost help us know that the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph Smith was a prophet, especially considering how God has revealed His gospel in every dispensation and how the Spirit of the Lord strengthens faith?","['<1-hop>\n\n**Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel. Previous dispensations have ended in apostasy (see D&C 136:36–38). – Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets all taught the gospel (see Moses 5:4–12). - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement – The Son of God restored and taught the gospel. He performed many miracles (see Bible Dictionary, “Miracles,” 732–33). – He called Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to preach the gospel and perform saving ordinances such as baptism (see John 15:16). – Christ established His Church. – Christ was crucified, and His Apostles were rejected and killed (see Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:25). – Christ accomplished the Atonement (see Bible Dictionary, “Atonement,” 617). - The Great Apostasy – Without revelation through a prophet, people fall into spiritual darkness (see Amos 8:11–12). – Prophets and Apostles foretold the Great Apostasy (see 2 Thessalonians 2:1–3). - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith – Joseph sought for truth (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10). – God and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17). – Like prophets in earlier dispensations, Joseph Smith was called as the prophet of this last dispensation. – God restored the fulness of the gospel through Joseph Smith (see D&C 35:17; 135:3). – Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Christ’s Church was organized (see D&C 13; 27:12). – A living prophet directs the Church today. - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ – The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. – Joseph translated the plates by the power of God (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraph 5). – The Book of Mormon proves that God inspires prophets in our day as He has in every dispensation (see D&C 20:5–12). – The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 20:8–9). - Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost – You can know that the Book of Mormon is true (see Moroni 10:3–5; Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 1, 8–9). – The Holy Ghost will teach you through your thoughts and feelings (see D&C 8:2–3). **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. #### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 58) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - If there were a prophet on the earth today, what would you ask him? - Do you believe that God hears your prayers? Why? - Would you like to find out that the Book of Mormon is true? Why? ### Key Definitions (page 58) - **Agency:** The ability and privilege God']","The Holy Ghost helps us know that the Book of Mormon is true by teaching us through our thoughts and feelings when we pray with sincere heart and faith in Christ, as mentioned in the context about praying to know the truth. Additionally, the Spirit of the Lord strengthens our faith by revealing God's love and truth, just as He has done in every dispensation through prophets like Joseph Smith, who was called by God to restore the gospel. The context explains that God has revealed His gospel repeatedly through prophets, and the Holy Ghost confirms these truths to us today, helping us understand and believe in the divine origins of the Book of Mormon and the prophet Joseph Smith.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes),', '<2-hop>\n\nfor each key indicator. You may also set goals for your personal development. Do everything within your power to achieve your goals while respecting the agency of others. The ultimate measure of success is not in achieving goals alone but in the service you render and the progress of others. Goals are a means of helping you bring about much good among Heavenly Father’s children. They are not to be used to receive recognition. Carefully considered goals will give you clear direction and will help you fill your days with activities that help people strengthen their faith in the Savior and progress toward baptism, confirmation, and full activity in the Church. Challenging goals will help you work effectively and lead you to stretch and grow. Follow the guidelines below as you set goals: - Follow the Spirit. - Focus on the key indicators. - Focus on people. Although you will use numbers, be able to support your numbers with the names of people where possible. - Be specific and realistic, but set goals that will make you stretch. - Set weekly and daily goals. - Set goals for personal and companion study, including language study if you are learning another language. - Measure your progress each day, each week, and after each six-week period. When you fall short of a goal, evaluate your efforts and seek for ways to accomplish the goal. If needed, adjust your expectations. Over time your mission president may establish standards of excellence or mission goals intended to raise your vision and increase your faith. District, zone, and mission standards will help you stretch, work effectively, and reach higher levels of performance. They are not to be used as quotas that impose specific goals on you and your companion. “I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential. When one learns to master the principles of setting a goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he attains in this life.” – ELDER M. RUSSELL BALLARD TALK GIVEN TO SALT LAKE AREA YOUNG ADULTS, OCT. 18, 1981 #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 161) Set weekly goals for each indicator. For each goal, ask yourselves: - Are there names associated with the number? - Is the goal specific? - Is the goal realistic? - Will the goal make us stretch? - Are we committed to this goal? Discuss each goal. If necessary, determine how you might revise it and why. ## The Weekly Planning Session (Page 161) Once you have set goals, decide how you will achieve them. You and your companion should hold a weekly planning session on a day and at a time that is less productive for proselyting, such as Thursday or Friday morning. Your mission president will set the day and time of the weekly planning session. This weekly planning may take two to three hours to complete. Your discussion should focus on the needs of people and how to help them progress. During this weekly planning session, review past goals and set new goals for the coming week. Consider every aspect of your proselyting. Sunday evening is the recommended time for the weekly call-in report. A Sunday- evening report provides the most accurate and timely status of the mission because most baptisms and confirmations take place on Saturday or Sunday. Because the day you hold your weekly planning session is likely to be different from your reporting day, approach your weekly planning with 10 days in mind. For example, if your weekly planning session is on Thursday, you will review the progress on your goals so far that week, and you will plan what you need to do to achieve these goals through Sunday. Then, set goals and make plans for the next week from Monday to Sunday. On Sunday evening you will total and report the results from the past week, and you will have your plan ready for the coming week. Below is a description of how the planning guidelines apply to a weekly planning session. 1. Pray for and seek inspiration. Before you begin, have your Missionary Daily Planner and area book near. Begin your planning session with prayer. Seek inspiration as you discuss the needs of people and plan how to serve them and help them progress in the gospel. Pray specifically for your investigators. Have the faith to ask Heavenly Father to bless them with answers to their prayers, with a desire to attend church, and so forth. 2. Set goals and make plans for investigators to be baptized and confirmed in the coming week. Review the Teaching Record for each person who is committed to be baptized or confirmed in the coming week. Discuss the arrangements you need to make for baptismal interviews, services, and confirmations. Using the Teaching Record, discuss any commitments these people may be struggling with and how you can help them. Plan to make daily contact with them. Discuss how you can help the ward mission leader coordinate with the bishop for their confirmations in sacrament meeting. 3. Set goals and make plans for investigators with a baptismal date. Review the Teaching Record for each person who will be baptized in the coming weeks. Talk about lessons you need to teach them. Consider how you can help them prepare for baptism and confirmation. Discuss investigators who were not baptized on their scheduled day. Carefully consider and discuss their needs. Set new goals and make plans that will help them progress toward a specific day and time when they can enter into the covenant of baptism and receive the ordinance of confirmation. On your Teaching Record, mark in pencil the principles you plan to teach and the commitments you will help them']","Based on the context, managing time and setting goals are essential for effective missionary work. <1-hop> Preach My Gospel emphasizes the importance of studying the scriptures, applying principles, and evaluating your work regularly to improve spiritually and professionally. <2-hop> The weekly planning session involves prayer, setting specific and realistic goals for investigators and personal development, and reviewing progress to help people progress toward baptism and confirmation.

How do sealing and covenants relate to the role of the Holy Ghost in teachin and guidin in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nactivities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ## The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power? Study Alma 17:2–3, D&C 53:3, 1 Corinthians 2:4 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 19) Look at the painting of Christ ordaining the Apostles, and then read John 15:1–16. - In what way is Christ the vine? How are you a branch of that vine? How does your setting apart relate to this relationship? - Read again your ministerial certificate. Record your feelings and thoughts about what you read. Each time you study this chapter, repeat this process. Note how your feelings change over time. - Study Doctrine and Covenants 109:13–15, 21–30, 38–39, 55–57, which are excerpts from the Prophet Joseph Smith’s inspired dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple. What blessings did Joseph Smith request for the faithful? ## The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 19) The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work. The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will,', '<2-hop>\n\nGhost,” 704). As a member of the Church, you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost by priesthood authority. This gift entitles you to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as you remain worthy of it. Pray for the Spirit’s guidance, and valiantly follow the promptings you receive. “The gift of the Holy Ghost comes after one repents and becomes worthy. . . . The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ so deeply that no earthly power or authority can separate him from that knowledge."" – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST—A SURE COMPASS,” ENSIGN, APR. 1996, 4 - **The Holy Spirit of Promise.** The Holy Ghost is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise (see D&C 88:3). To be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable to God. The Holy Spirit of Promise testifies to the Father that the saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants associated with them have been kept. Those who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has (see D&C 76:51–60; Ephesians 1:13–14). All covenants and performances must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise if they are to be valid after this life (see D&C 132:7, 18–19, 26). Breaking covenants may remove the sealing. - **Gifts of the Spirit.** The gifts of the Spirit are special spiritual blessings that the Lord gives to worthy individuals for their own benefit and for their use in blessing others. For example, missionaries who must learn a new language may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help in learning a language. Several gifts of the Spirit are described in Moroni 10:8–18; Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33; and 1 Corinthians 12:1–12. These are only some examples of the many gifts of the Spirit. The Lord may bless you in other ways depending on your faithfulness, your needs, and the needs of those you serve. You should desire spiritual gifts and earnestly seek for them (see D&C 46:8; 1 Corinthians 12:31; 14:1, 12). These gifts come by prayer, faith, and works, according to God’s will (see D&C 63:9–12; 84:64–73). #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 106) Read the references below: - Bible Dictionary, “Holy Ghost,” “Light of Christ,” and “Spirit.” - Our Search for Happiness, 84–86, 91–92. - True to the Faith, “Holy Ghost,” 81–84, and “Spiritual Gifts,” 165–67. Write a description of the nature and role of the Holy Ghost. - Read Acts 4:23–33. - How did Peter and John seek spiritual gifts? - How did the Lord answer their prayers? - What can you learn from this experience about your own work? ## The Power of the Spirit in Conversion (Page 106) The power of the Holy Ghost is central to conversion. Strive to understand the doctrine of conversion and also the experience of conversion. President Boyd K. Packer explained the central role of the Spirit in conversion: “When conversion takes place, it is through the power of the Spirit. In order to succeed in missionary work, these three things must occur: “We must understand what an investigator must feel in order to receive conversion. “We must understand how a missionary must feel in order to teach with the converting power of the Spirit. “And then we must understand how a member must feel to succeed in participating in the conversion experience” (mission presidents’ conference, 3 Apr. 1985). The better you understand how investigators, missionaries, and members feel when they receive the witness of the Spirit, the better you will understand your own role, which is to: - Be edified and have your mind enlightened as you search the scriptures and teach the doctrine. - Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear witness. You do this by teaching and testifying of the message of the Restoration. Teach as directed by the Spirit, and testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true. - Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting the message to each person’s needs. - Invite people to act. Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and make and keep covenants. Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke of the power of the Spirit: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed. When individuals . . . feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word. This is how we come to feel the gospel is true” (“Now Is the Time,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 75). The Holy Ghost works in the hearts of people to bring about these changes. As people choose to keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly and will develop the faith to obey Christ. Thus, you should help the people you work with grow in faith by inviting them to repent and to make and keep commitments. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 107) - Read one or two of the following passages, and ponder what an investigator must feel to be converted. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and members: 2 Nephi 4:16–35; Enos 1; Mosiah 4–5; 18:7–14; 27–28; Alma 5; 17–22; 32; 36; 38 - Read one or two of the following passages and ponder what you as a missionary and as a member must feel to teach with converting power. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and']","Sealing and covenants are essential aspects of missionary work that are confirmed and sealed by the Holy Ghost, who testifies of the truth and helps individuals accept and keep their covenants. The Holy Ghost's role in teaching, testifying, and guidin ensures that the gospel message is taught by divine power, enabling missionaries to help others understand the importance of sealing ordinances and covenants, and to receive the Holy Spirit of Promise that confirms their righteousness and acceptance before God.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How does the plan of salvation connect with scripture study and teaching gospel to help people come unto Christ and understand the restoration?,"['<1-hop>\n\nand His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. #### Scripture Study (Page 20) What is the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ? - Read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27:13–22 for answers to the question.', '<2-hop>\n\nand pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost']","The plan of salvation explains that through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and enduring to the end, individuals can be sanctified and return to God's presence. Scripture study, especially of the Book of Mormon and other scriptures, helps individuals gain a testimony of these principles and the restoration of the gospel. Teaching the gospel and encouraging prayer allows people to feel the Holy Ghost's confirmation of truth, which supports their spiritual journey and understanding of the plan of salvation.

"How do Acts emphasize the importance of spiritual preparation and obedience for baptism, and how does this relate to the guidance provided in the baptismal interview questions and teachings on moral worthiness?","['<1-hop>\n\n- Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Be willing to take upon them the name of Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto a remission of their sins. 2. First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve: - Make sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. - Develop faith in Christ. - Repent of transgressions. - Live the principles of moral worthiness. - Live the Word of Wisdom. - Commit to pay tithing. - Receive all the missionary lessons [lessons 1–4 on the Teaching Record and associated commitments]. - Meet the bishop or branch president. - Attend several sacrament meetings. (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002) When an investigator has set a firm baptismal date, schedule when you will complete all the events that lead to baptism and confirmation as listed in your daily planner. Carefully review the Teaching Record to ensure that you have taught the basic doctrines and that the candidates are prepared to address each question in the baptismal interview. Review this schedule with the person in your next meeting. If possible, the person should attend a baptismal service prior to his or her own baptism. If you feel that the person you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule an interview until the investigator meets the standards. If the candidate is a minor, ensure that the parents or guardians have given permission, preferably in writing, for him or her to be baptized. As you help people prepare for their baptismal interview, talk to them about the purpose of the interview. Teach them and bear testimony about the sacredness of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Explain that you want to make sure they understand the principles you have taught and the covenant they will make. Also explain that the interview is an opportunity for them to witness before the Lord’s representative that they are ready for these sacred ordinances. As they keep the covenant made at baptism and confirmation, they will receive a remission of sins. Share the questions the interviewer will ask about their belief in important doctrines, their repentance of past sins, and their willingness to covenant to obey Jesus Christ throughout their lives. Emphasize that baptism by water is incomplete without confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 219) - Read each of the following passages, and make a summary list of the scriptural qualifications for baptism and confirmation. - 2 Nephi 9:23, 31:4-13; 3 Nephi 27:13-21, D&C 20:37 - Mosiah 18:8-10, Moroni 6:1-4, D&C 22 - Alma 7:14-15, Moroni 8:25-26, Acts 2:37-39 - In baptismal interviews, candidates are asked whether they are willing to take upon themselves the name of Christ. What can you do to help them understand this question? As you ponder this question, study the following scriptures: - Mosiah 4–5, Mosiah 18:1–11, Mosiah 26:18, 21–27; 3 Nephi 27:1–10 You may also want to look for other passages that help you understand this principle. ## How to Conduct the Interview (Page 219) The person conducting the interview should use the baptismal interview questions with the guidance of the Spirit to determine whether the baptismal candidate meets the qualifications described in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. He should also adapt the questions to the age and maturity of the candidate. If a candidate does not qualify according to the baptismal interview questions, the baptism and confirmation should be postponed. The investigator should receive additional teaching by the full-time missionaries and fellowshipping from ward members. The district leader or zone leader who conducts the interview should: - Hold the interview in a comfortable, private place, conducive to feeling the Spirit of the Lord. The interviewer’s companion should be nearby. - Open with prayer. - Help the candidate feel comfortable. - Make the interview a spiritually uplifting experience. - Make sure that the candidate understands the purpose of the interview. - Ask the baptismal interview questions. Use follow-up questions to get a feeling for the strength of the person’s testimony and the sincerity of the person’s repentance. - Answer the candidate’s questions. - Invite the person to bear testimony and express his or her feelings. - If the person has challenges with testimony or worthiness, explain that it would be best to postpone the baptism until he or she is better prepared. #### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 220) 1. Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world? 2. Do you believe the Church and gospel of Jesus Christ have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith? Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God? What does this mean to you? 3. What does it mean to you to repent? Do you feel that you have repented of your past transgressions? 4. Have you ever committed a serious crime? If so, are you now on probation or parole? Have you ever participated in an abortion? a homosexual relationship? 5. You have been taught that membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints includes living gospel standards. What do you understand of the following standards? Are you willing to obey them? - The law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relationship outside the bonds of a legal marriage between a man and a woman. - The law of tithing. - The Word of Wisdom. - The Sabbath day, including partaking of the sacrament weekly and rendering service to fellow members. 6. When you are baptized, you covenant with God that you are willing to take upon yourself the name of Christ and keep His commandments throughout your life. Are you ready', '<2-hop>\n\nquestions to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation. The lessons also have ideas for teaching. Use these suggestions to strengthen how you prepare and teach. ### The Role of Memorization (Page 44) Memorize scriptures to use in your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal points in each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language should focus their language study on preparing to teach the missionary lessons. They should memorize vocabu- lary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons. ### Teach with Clarity (Page 44) At the end of the first three lessons is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to make the message easy to understand. ### Scripture Study (Page 44) What are you directed to teach? Study Mosiah 18:18–20, D&C 43:15–16 and D&C 52:9 to find the answers to this question. Why must you study the doctrines in the lessons? Study Alma 17:2–3 and D&C 84:85 to find answers to this question. > Lesson One # 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 45) ## Your Purpose (Page 45) As you teach, prepare your investigators to meet the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the baptismal interview questions. This is best accomplished by inviting your investigators to make and keep the commitments listed below. ### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 45) - Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father? - Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world? - Do you believe that the Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith? - Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God? What does this mean to you? ### Commitments (Page 45) - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Other commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. > Lesson one: First Principle ## God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father (Page 45) God is our Heavenly Father. We are His children. He has a body of flesh and bone that is glorified and perfected. He loves us. He weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right. He wants to communicate with us, and we can communicate with Him through sincere prayer. He has given us this experience on the earth so we can learn and grow. We can show our love for Him through our choices and our obedience to His commandments. Heavenly Father has provided us, His children, with a way to be successful in this life and to return to live in His presence. However, we must be pure and clean through obedience in order to do so. Disobedience moves us away from Him. Central to our Father’s plan is Jesus Christ’s Atonement. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane as well as His suffering and death on the cross. Through the Atonement we can be freed from the burden of our sins and develop faith and strength to face our trials. ### Belief about God (Page 46) Determine what each person you are teaching understands regarding Christian beliefs about God. Many people in today’s world either have no concept of God or a very different perception of Deity. Two Book of Mormon missionaries, Ammon and Aaron, taught people who did not have a Christian background. They taught simple truths and invited their investigators to pray. Lamoni and his father were converted. Read Alma 18:24–40 and 22:4–23, and answer the questions below: - What did these missionaries teach about the nature of God? - How can you follow their examples? #### Scripture Study (Page 46) **What is the nature of God the Father and Jesus Christ?** Study the following scriptures to find answers to the question. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 Nephl 17:36 | 3 Nephl 27:13-22 | John 3:16-17 | | 2 Nephi 9:6 | D&C 38:1-3 | Acts 17:27-29 | | Mosiah 4:9 | D&C 130:22 | Romans 8:16 | | 3 Nephi 12:48 | Moses 1:39 | Hebrews 12:9 | | 3 Nephi 14:9-11 | Matthew 5:48 | 1 John 4:7-9 | > Lesson Two: Second Principle ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 46) The restored gospel blesses and helps husbands and wives, parents and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and spiritual strength in their families. These blessings are available now and in eternity. The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current concerns and challenges. Because families are ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in eternity. God has established families to bring happiness to His children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere, and prepare them for eternal life. The home is the best place to teach, learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing family members with peace, joy, and happiness. Through prophets in every age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for individuals and families. > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation (Page 46) One important way that God shows His love for us is by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the power and authority given']","The context highlights that Acts, specifically Acts 2:37-39, emphasize the significance of sincere repentance, faith, and willingness to obey God's commandments as essential prerequisites for baptism. It underscores that candidates must demonstrate a broken heart, contrite spirit, and a commitment to take upon the name of Christ, aligning with the principles taught in the baptismal interview questions, which assess belief in God, Jesus Christ, and willingness to obey commandments such as the Word of Wisdom and law of chastity. Both sources stress that baptism is a sacred covenant requiring moral worthiness and understanding of gospel principles, ensuring that candidates are spiritually prepared and committed to follow Christ throughout their lives.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How do pages 38 and 43 in the manual help missionaries understand gospel principles and definitions for effective teaching?,"['<1-hop>\n\nor two questions about the gospel principles and doctrines from one of the lessons in chapter 3 for which they would like to find an answer. Invite the missionaries to share their questions with the group. For each question, discuss the following: – How will answering this question bless the life of the missionary? – How will it bless the lives of investigators? – How could a missionary find the answer? 4. Ask several missionaries to share a gospel principle that their companions have taught them. Ask them to explain the principle and how their companion taught it to them. 5. Organize missionaries into companionships or small groups. Assign each group to read one chapter from the Book of Mormon. Have each group select one idea from each of the categories in the section “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Invite the groups to apply each suggestion as they read their chapter together. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for reading and discussion. Have each group explain the suggestions they used, how well the suggestions worked, and what they learned. 6. Invite each missionary to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to him or her (such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites). Invite the missionaries to sketch or describe how they visualize the accounts they have chosen. Invite two or three missionaries to share what they visualize. Ask others to tell the stories and relate them to doctrines in one of the lessons. Read Moroni 10:3 and discuss the value of pondering deeply about spiritual knowledge. ### Mission President (Page 41) 1. Invite missionaries to bring their study journals to interviews. Invite them to share one entry with you. 2. During interviews, ask some of the following questions: – What impressions have you had recently in your scripture study? – What is one gospel principle that your companion has recently taught you? – What chapter or section of this manual has helped you most in the past two weeks? – What are you doing in your personal study that helps you learn the most? 3. During zone conferences, invite missionaries to share meaningful experiences they have had in their personal and companion study. 4. During zone conferences, allow missionaries to share personal study ideas. 5. Share with missionaries insights you have had in your personal study. Share entries from your study journal and your testimony of the importance of gospel study. 6. As you can, join missionaries in their companion study. 7. During interviews, invite missionaries to share one of their lesson plans from one of the missionary lessons. Ask them what these doctrines mean to them. > Beginning of chapter 3 of the 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Do I Study and Teach? (Page 43) The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrines, principles, and commandments that you are to study, believe, love, live, and teach. They are what the living prophets and apostles have directed you to teach. They are organized so that you can help others clearly understand the doctrines of Christ. The lessons in this chapter are: 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 2. The Plan of Salvation 3. The Gospel of Jesus Christ 4. The Commandments 5. Laws and Ordinances Teach the first four lessons before baptism. Make sure those you teach qualify for baptism and confirmation by making and keeping all of the commitments in these lessons. Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching lessons before baptism with the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, new members are taught the first four lessons again, as well as “Laws and Ordinances.” Ward leaders determine whether ward missionaries or full-time missionaries lead out in ensuring that these lessons are taught and how long full-time missionaries are involved. Encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons. You should also use these lessons in individual and companion study, district meetings, and other training settings. As you study the scriptures and treasure up in your mind the doctrines in these lessons, the Spirit will give you in the very hour what you should say and do to help others receive a witness of the truthfulness of the teachings. As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and prepare to teach, keep firmly in mind these instructions. Make sure that you teach all the doctrines in these lessons. Unless directed by the Spirit, for each of the first three lessons, you should give the full content in the order in which they are written. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Each lesson outlines the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrines that you are to teach. Thoroughly learn the doctrines. Consistently focus on helping those you teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview', '<2-hop>\n\ndefinitions and terms in the ”Ideas for Teaching“ section of each lesson. Become familiar with the definitions provided. Use True to the Faith and the Bible Dictionary to find definitions for other words. Write these definitions in your study journal. Share the definitions with your companion and others to see if you understand. If the definitions are unclear to others, revise your definitions based on the material you have studied. As you teach, seek to discern whether a word or principle is new to the person you are teaching. Take time to explain unfamiliar words or principles. Remember to teach for understanding so that you and those you teach “are edified and rejoice together” (D&C 50:22). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 35) Turn to the lesson “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ” located in chapter 3. Read the list of key definitions in the “Ideas for Teaching” section. Locate three other words in the lesson that you would like to define. Follow the suggestions given above in creating a definition for each. ## Study Ideas and Suggestions (Page 36) Each of the ideas and suggestions in this section can make your study time more rewarding and spiritually uplifting. Consider the following as you plan your study: - Always begin with a prayer. - Plan study activities that will build your faith in the Savior and use your time productively. - Plan your study around people, their needs, and preparing them for baptism, confirmation, and enduring to the end. Note your study plans in your daily planner. - Plan your study by asking: What will I be teaching today? How can I plan my study to best help those I teach? Which ideas and suggestions from this section will I incorporate in my study? As you plan your study activities, experiment with some of the ideas and suggestions that follow or with additional ideas you learn from others. ### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ### See the Big Picture (Page 37) - Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background. - Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph. - Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain. - Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 37) Read the chapter summaries of the books below and write an outline that describes the setting, main events, and main doctrines of each book. - 1 Nephi - Moses - Acts ### Explore the Details (Page 38) - Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions. Examine surrounding words or phrases for clues to what the key words mean. - Look for connecting words, such as therefore, and again, thus, wherefore, and others. Then see how the preceding and following passages relate to each other. - Use the Topical Guide to']","Page 38 provides guidance on defining key words and principles in the 'Ideas for Teaching' section, encouraging missionaries to use resources like True to the Faith and the Bible Dictionary to ensure understanding.

"How does 1 Nephi 4:6 relate to relying on the Spirit in missionary work, and why is it important for missionaries to trust the Spirit rather than their own talents according to the context?","['<1-hop>\n\nConstrains (impels forward) or restrains (holds back). | | D&C 50:13-22 | Edifies both teacher and students. | | D&C 88:3; John 14:26 | Gives comfort. | ## Relying on the Spirit (Page 111) As the Lord’s servant, you are to do His work in His way and by His power. Some missionaries feel confident that they know how to be successful. Others lack such confidence. Remember, however, that your confidence and faith should be in Christ, not in yourself. Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and abilities. Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Spirit is basic to teaching and preaching: “No man can preach the Gospel without the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 2:477). “Some few were called and ordained by the Spirit of revelation and prophecy, and began to preach as the Spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened by the power of God” (History of the Church, 4:538). “[Joseph Smith] proceeded to give instruction to the Elders respecting preaching the Gospel, and pressed upon them the necessity of getting the Spirit, so that they might preach with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven” (History of the Church, 4:13). During your weekly and daily planning sessions, you will need to ask some basic questions every day—even many times each day (see the Scripture Study box that follows for examples of questions). Seek inspiration to answer these questions in a way that meets each situation. The answers should then take shape in your plans. But you should also be willing to follow the Spirit and change your plans when unforeseen opportunities arise. Study the following scriptures and consider how they answer these important questions that you should ask each day. Consider what these passages mean for your finding efforts, planning sessions, and personal and companion study. Also consider their meaning as you teach the lessons, invite people to make commitments, follow up on commitments, strengthen new members and less-active members, and work with members. #### Scripture Study (page 112) - Where should I go? - Helaman 10:17, D&C 31:11 - D&C 75:26–27, D&C 79:1–2 - What should I do? - 1 Nephi 4:6, 2 Nephi 32:2–5 - D&C 28:15, D&C 52:3–4 - What should I say? - 2 Nephi 33:1, Alma 5:43–46, Alma 11:22, Helaman 5:18, Helaman 13:3–5 - D&C 33:8–10, D&C 50:13–22, D&C 68:1–4, D&C 75:3–11, D&C 100:5–8 - Matthew 10:19–20, Mark 13:11, 1 Corinthians 2:4–5...12–13, Exodus 4:10–12 - How do I adapt my teaching to the needs of my investigators? - Alma 12:7, Alma 41:1 - 3 Nephi 17:2–3, D&C 71:1, D&C 84:85 - Which scriptures should I use and how should I use them? - Mosiah 18:19-20, D&C 32:4, D&C 71:1 - Mosiah 27:35, D&C 42:11-17, D&C 80:4 = D&C 18:32-36, D&C 68:1-4, Luke 24:13-32 ## A Word of Caution (Page 112) As you pray for inspiration, you should also confirm your feelings. For example, compare your decisions with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets. Be certain that the feelings are consistent with the assignment you have; for example, you will not receive revelation to tell a local bishop how he should perform in his calling. Discuss your decisions and conclusions with your companion, your district leader, or your mission president when appropriate. President Howard W. Hunter offered this counsel: “Let me offer a word of caution. . . . I think if we are not careful . . . , we may begin to try to counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means. I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit. Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” (The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter, 184). The Spirit of the Lord always edifies. Revelation and spiritual experiences are sacred. They should be kept private and discussed only in appropriate situations. As a missionary, you may be more aware of spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life. Resist the temptation to talk freely about these experiences. President Boyd K. Packer counseled: “I have learned that strong, impressive spiritual experiences do not come to us very frequently. And when they do, they are generally for our own edification, instruction, or correction. Unless we are called by proper authority to do so, they do not position us to counsel or to correct others. “I have come to believe also that it is not wise to continually talk of unusual spiritual experiences. They are to be guarded with care and shared only when the Spirit itself prompts you to use them to the blessing of others” (Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). “If worthy, we are entitled to receive revelations for ourselves, parents for their children, and members of the Church in their callings. But the right of revelation for others does not extend beyond our own stewardship.” – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “COMMUNION WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT,” ENSIGN, MAR. 2002, 4. #### Scripture Study (Page 113) Relying on the Spirit is so important that the Lord warns us very strongly not to deny or quench the Spirit. What do you learn from the following passages of scripture? - Jacob 6:8–9 3 Nephi 29:5–6 - Mormon 9:7–9 Moroni 10:7–8 - D&C 11:25–26 1 Thessalonians 5:19–20 #### Remember This (Page 113) - Pray with faith that your prayers will be answered. - Learn to understand, recognize, and follow the promptings of the Spirit. - Learn to rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Teach others how to recognize the Spirit. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 114) ### Personal Study (Page 114) - Record your spiritual experiences in your journal.

Why is it so important? - What is my responsibility in helping others become converted? - How will I know whether I am a successful missionary? > Questions to help study this chapter by looking for the answers ## Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 15) You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. All of them are children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (D&C 59:23), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of guilt that come from mistakes and sins. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (2 Nephi 2:6, 8). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, Title Page). As your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great . . . importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (2 Nephi 2:8). President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world. That is the cause that must unite us today. Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167). You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. To come to the Savior they must have faith in Him unto repentance— making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenants of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). ### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11. In this vision, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God (see 1 Nephi 11:21–22). - In the vision, what did the people need to do to be able to partake of the fruit? What do we need to do to receive all the blessings of the Atonement? In what ways do commitments and covenants help us partake of these blessings? - As a missionary, what is your duty in helping others find and partake of the fruits of the gospel? - What did Lehi desire after he had eaten the fruit? (See 1 Nephi 8:10–18.) ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 17) The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for families: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational']","In the context, 1 Nephi 4:6 emphasizes the importance of relying on the Spirit rather than one's own abilities when doing the Lord's work. The context explains that some missionaries feel confident in their success, but they should place their confidence and faith in Christ and trust the Spirit to guide their actions. Relying on the Spirit is fundamental to effective teaching and preaching, as it ensures that their efforts are aligned with God's will. Therefore, 1 Nephi 4:6 relates directly to the theme of trusting the Spirit, highlighting that success in missionary work comes through divine guidance rather than personal talents alone.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

He assigns young missionaries to be trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants. Assistants, office missionaries, and other missionaries do not make missionary leadership assignments or assign the areas where you serve. However, the mission president may counsel with his wife or his assistants about missionary assignments.

These leaders counsel about meeting the needs of the missionaries and make plans to help the mission progress and to move the work forward. > 2.1.4 ### Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities Young missionary leaders, like all missionaries, follow the counsel of Jesus Christ to “serve [God] with all [their] heart, might, mind and strength” and to “remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence” (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2, 6). Leadership assignments do not indicate special recognition or advancement or reflect the worth of a missionary. Young missionary leaders have the responsibility to: - Find, teach, baptize, and fellowship people. - Set an example of missionary standards for behavior (see 3.0). - Train other missionaries and lead companion exchanges (see 2.3.1). - Share information and direction from the mission leadership council with the missionaries they lead. - Love and befriend other missionaries. Help them recognize the value of their efforts. - Listen to other missionaries’ concerns. Give support and counsel. - Correct other missionaries kindly and privately, as needed, followed by “an increase of love” (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–43). - Work closely with local leaders and members. Like all missionaries, elders and sisters with leadership assignments should practice Christlike leadership. If the conduct of any missionary, including young missionary leaders, seems inconsistent with the commandments and missionary standards, discuss the issue with the missionary. If the issue is not then resolved, share your concerns with your young missionary leaders or mission president and not with other missionaries, members, or friends. For more information about the specific assignments and responsibilities of young missionary leaders (trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants to the president), see section 7.1, “Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities.” > 2.1.5 ### Personal Responsibilities “Magnify [your] office unto the Lord” (Jacob 1:19), become spiritually self-reliant, and “act for [yourself]” (2 Nephi 2:16) by trusting the Lord and following the Spirit. When you have questions or concerns: Apply the teaching to “study it out in your mind; then … ask me if it be right” (Doctrine and Covenants 9:8). Seek guidance through personal revelation; prayer; and study of the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets, and these standards. If you need additional help after applying these principles, ask your companion or young missionary leaders. Often, they can help you find answers to your questions and resolve your concerns. If not, reach out to either of your mission leaders, your parents, or your home priesthood leaders. Please do not contact Church headquarters. If you do, you will be referred back to your mission president. Talk with your mission president about worthiness issues. Talk with either of your mission leaders about immediate safety concerns, including assault or abuse, or other issues that cannot be resolved with other missionaries. There may be times during your mission when you find it difficult to focus on your work due to current challenges, personal or family matters, or even past experiences. That is understandable. Do not hesitate to share your concerns with your companion, young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders and to reach out for support. Remember the Savior’s invitation: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen” (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36–37). > 2.2 ## Companions The Lord calls missionaries to preach His gospel in companionships. “Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands” (Doctrine and Covenants 52:10). You will work with different companions throughout your mission. Companions: Become united in the work and together testify of Jesus Christ. Support each other’s spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. Try to keep each other safe. Are accountable to each other in keeping missionary standards. > 2.2.1 ### Supporting Each Other Companions should help each other learn, grow, and develop Christlike attributes (see Doctrine and Covenants 4 and “How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 6). Learning patience and love, practicing forgiveness, and accepting differences in personalities will bless you throughout your life. As companions: - Love, respect, and strengthen each other. - Study together every day and pray together frequently throughout the day. - Be humble and recognize each other’s strengths. - Treat each other as you would like to be treated. - Avoid criticism and contention. - Avoid speaking negatively about each other to other missionaries, Church members, or family and friends at home. If you notice any inappropriate situation or behavior, discuss it with your companion. If the matter is not resolved or if your companion is being abusive, have the courage and love for your companion to ask your mission president for help (see 3.9.2). > 2.2.2 ### Staying Together Staying with your companion will help provide protection from physical and spiritual dangers, false accusations, and loneliness. Obey this missionary standard at all times and in all places. Never be alone. You', '<2-hop>\n\n## How to Begin Teaching (Page 190) The first few moments with investigators are very important. Investigators must learn to trust you. Begin your first visit in a warm, respectful, genuine manner. Ask a few simple questions to help you understand their religious background and their expectations regarding your visits. For example, ask, “What role has religion played in your life?” Do not, however, ask personal questions that would make them uncomfortable. Before you begin, ask all who are present to join with you in the lesson. Encourage them to turn off the television and remove other distractions so that the Spirit of the Lord will not be hindered. Explain that you would like to begin and end each lesson in prayer. Suggest that you will offer the opening prayer. Pray simply but fervently that the Lord will bless the people you are teaching in every aspect of their lives, and especially that they can feel the truth of what you will teach. Demonstrate sincere interest and love for the investigators and faith in the converting power of the gospel (see Moroni 7:43–48). As guided by the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following to your investigators: - Because God is our Heavenly Father, we are all brothers and sisters. We would like to refer to you as brothers and sisters. - Each person we teach has personal challenges and concerns. No matter what your needs or concerns might be, the Savior and His teachings—the gospel—will help you. - Our message will enable you to improve the quality of your lives. It will help you deal with the problems and challenges that we all face in life. - Our message, which is centered in Jesus Christ, is of great value and importance. - We all make mistakes in life, and these mistakes create feelings of guilt and shame. These feelings cannot be relieved without repentance and forgiveness. They can be fully healed through the Atonement of Christ. - Our message cannot be learned all at once. Understanding will come over time through prayer, study, experience, and keeping God’s commandments. - We have weaknesses, as everyone does. We may not speak the language very well or be able to answer every question you have. But we have been called by a prophet of God to share what we know. We know that our message is true. - We will be guides so that you can learn the truth of our message for yourselves. It is your choice to accept and act on the message. Therefore, you should feel free to ask questions. - As you sincerely seek to understand our message, you may face challenges, but God will help you. - As you accept our message, you will learn how to make covenants, or promises, with God. You will learn how to make changes to bring your lives in closer harmony with His teachings. You will want to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be baptized by proper authority (see John 3:5). Before teaching the doctrines in a lesson, consider giving a simple overview of what you are going to teach. Help people see that it will have personal relevance for them. Many of the investigators you teach have been prepared by the Lord (see Alma 16:16–17). As you share spiritual experiences together in the first meeting, they will recognize you as servants of the Lord.']","The context explains that mission leadership, organized through priesthood keys and revelation, helps facilitate the work of bringing people to the Savior. Young missionary leaders are responsible for finding, teaching, and baptizing, which directly supports the Savior's mission to save and guide His followers. They are also tasked with setting an example of Christlike behavior, training others, and working closely with local leaders, all of which help create an environment where investigators can learn about and come unto the Savior. The emphasis on loving, supporting, and serving others reflects the Savior's role as the ultimate example of service and salvation, guiding missionaries to help others develop faith in Him.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the Apostle Paul’s teaching in Romans relate to the principles of repentance, baptism, and living a Christlike life as outlined in the context of missionary work and gospel principles?","['<1-hop>\n\nfrom our sins and do them no more. We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper. Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son. Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions. In addition, we should continually improve—to develop Christlike qualities, to grow in knowledge, and to serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior expects of us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily. #### Scripture Study (Page 77) - We All Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:7–8 - Repentance: Alma 34:8–17, D&C 58:42–43, D&C 61:2, 2 Corinthians 7:9–10, Bible Dictionary, “Repentance” - Redemption and Forgiveness: Helaman 5:10–11 - Mercy Claims the Penitent: Alma 12:32–35, Alma 42:13, 21–24, D&C 18:10–13 > Lesson Three: Fourth Principle ## Baptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. #### Before Baptism (Page 78) “Ensure that [investigators] have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. Investigators should live the principles of moral worthiness, the Word of Wisdom, and commit to pay tithing. If missionaries feel additional preparation is needed, they should postpone baptism until the investigator meets the standard. *“Before baptism each investigator should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch president, and attend several sacrament meetings”* (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). #### Scripture Study (Page 79) - Christ’s Example: 2 Nephi 31:4–18, Matthew 3:13–17 - The Baptismal Covenant: Mosiah 5:8–10, Mosiah 18:8–10, D&C 20:37 - Qualifications', '<2-hop>\n\nactivities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ## The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power?

This aligns with the context’s emphasis on sincere repentance bringing forgiveness, peace, and the influence of the Spirit, which prepares individuals for baptism—an ordinance symbolizing death to sin and rebirth as a disciple of Christ. The context also underscores that keeping covenants, such as baptism, and striving to develop Christlike qualities are essential for living a life aligned with the gospel.

Why is it so important? - What is my responsibility in helping others become converted? - How will I know whether I am a successful missionary? > Questions to help study this chapter by looking for the answers ## Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 15) You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. All of them are children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (D&C 59:23), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of guilt that come from mistakes and sins. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (2 Nephi 2:6, 8). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, Title Page). As your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great . . . importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (2 Nephi 2:8). President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world. That is the cause that must unite us today. Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167). You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. To come to the Savior they must have faith in Him unto repentance— making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenants of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). ### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11. In this vision, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God (see 1 Nephi 11:21–22). - In the vision, what did the people need to do to be able to partake of the fruit?

(See 1 Nephi 8:10–18.) ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 17) The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for families: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational']","Ezra Taft Benson emphasize Spirit is key in mission work, inviting Spirit helps teach and bring success.

The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will, and His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. #### Scripture Study (Page 20) What is the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ? - Read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27:13–22 for answers to the question. ## The Message of the Restoration: The Foundation of Faith (Page 20) No matter where you serve or whom you teach, center your teaching on the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ of the gospel of Jesus Christ. “The Lord will bless you as you teach the message of the Restoration to a world that desperately needs the gospel of Jesus Christ” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you study the doctrines in the missionary lessons, you will come to see that we have one message: Through a modern prophet, God has restored knowledge about the plan of salvation, which is centered on Christ’s Atonement and fulfilled by living the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Make sure that everyone you teach clearly understands the following: - God is our literal Father in Heaven. He loves us. Every person on earth is a child of God and a member of God’s family. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior and Redeemer. - Our loving Father in Heaven reached out to His children throughout biblical history by revealing His gospel to prophets. Sadly, many people rejected that gospel; even some of those who accepted it changed gospel doctrines and ordinances and fell into unbelief and apostasy. - Our Father in Heaven sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. He performed miracles and taught His gospel. He accomplished the Atonement and was resurrected. - Beginning with the First Vision, God has again reached out in love to His children. He restored the gospel of Jesus Christ and His priesthood authority and organized His Church on the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence of this Restoration. As you help investigators see the pattern of apostasy and restoration, they will be prepared to understand the great need for the latter-day Restoration. They will see the need to accept the restored gospel, receive the ordinances of salvation by the authority of the restored priesthood, and follow the way to eternal life. Help people recognize that the Church is not just another religion, nor is it an American church. Rather, it is a restoration of the “fulness of [the] gospel” (D&C 1:23), the same as was revealed and taught from the beginning. The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. It is the keystone of our religion, the most powerful resource for teaching this message.']","The concept of Restoration is central to the doctrines highlighted in both segments. The first segment emphasizes using the Book of Mormon as a key resource in teaching restored truth, which is a direct application of the Restoration theme, as it testifies of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the priesthood authority restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The second segment explains that the Restoration involves the re-establishment of the gospel of Jesus Christ, including the priesthood authority and the organization of the Church, which are essential doctrines for missionary work. Together, these segments support the idea that understanding and teaching the Restoration—centered on Christ’s Atonement, the priesthood, and the Book of Mormon—are foundational for effectively sharing the gospel and helping others come unto Christ.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How do the principles outlined in Acts relate to the importance of obedience and standards for life as emphasized in the missionary experience described in Acts?,"['<1-hop>\n\nYour Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission', '<2-hop>\n\nfor Baptism: 2 Nephi 9:23, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 7:14–15, 3 Nephi 11:23–27, Moroni 6:1–4, D&C 20:37, Acts 2:37–39 - The Lord Institutes the Sacrament: 3 Nephi 18:1–18, Luke 22:15–20 - Promised Blessings of Baptism: Mosiah 4:11–12, 26, Moroni 8:25–26, John 3:5, Romans 6:4 - The Sacrament Prayers: Moroni 4 and 5, D&C 20:75–79 - Partaking of the Sacrament: D&C 27:2, 1 Corinthians 11:23–29 - Necessity for Authority: D&C 22, Hebrews 5:4 > Lesson Three: Fifth Principle ## The Gift of the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and']","The principles outlined in Acts, such as obedience to God's commandments and the importance of living according to His standards, directly relate to the emphasis on obedience and standards for life highlighted in the missionary experience. The full-time mission experience encourages missionaries to follow Christ's example by keeping His commandments with joy and sincerity, as taught in John 14:15 and Colossians 1:11. Similarly, Acts emphasizes the significance of obedience to God's will, which is essential for spiritual growth and fulfilling one's purpose as a disciple of Jesus Christ. Both contexts highlight that obedience to divine standards, including personal conduct and spiritual commitments, is vital for experiencing the blessings of the gospel and progressing on the covenant path toward eternal happiness and salvation.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does 1 Nephi 4:6 exemplify the importance of relying on the Spirit in missionary work, as emphasized in the context of using scriptures like 1 Nephi to guide teaching and decision-making?","['<1-hop>\n\nConstrains (impels forward) or restrains (holds back). | | D&C 50:13-22 | Edifies both teacher and students. | | D&C 88:3; John 14:26 | Gives comfort. | ## Relying on the Spirit (Page 111) As the Lord’s servant, you are to do His work in His way and by His power. Some missionaries feel confident that they know how to be successful. Others lack such confidence. Remember, however, that your confidence and faith should be in Christ, not in yourself. Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and abilities. Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Spirit is basic to teaching and preaching: “No man can preach the Gospel without the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 2:477). “Some few were called and ordained by the Spirit of revelation and prophecy, and began to preach as the Spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened by the power of God” (History of the Church, 4:538). “[Joseph Smith] proceeded to give instruction to the Elders respecting preaching the Gospel, and pressed upon them the necessity of getting the Spirit, so that they might preach with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven” (History of the Church, 4:13). During your weekly and daily planning sessions, you will need to ask some basic questions every day—even many times each day (see the Scripture Study box that follows for examples of questions). Seek inspiration to answer these questions in a way that meets each situation. The answers should then take shape in your plans. But you should also be willing to follow the Spirit and change your plans when unforeseen opportunities arise. Study the following scriptures and consider how they answer these important questions that you should ask each day. Consider what these passages mean for your finding efforts, planning sessions, and personal and companion study. Also consider their meaning as you teach the lessons, invite people to make commitments, follow up on commitments, strengthen new members and less-active members, and work with members. #### Scripture Study (page 112) - Where should I go? - Helaman 10:17, D&C 31:11 - D&C 75:26–27, D&C 79:1–2 - What should I do? - 1 Nephi 4:6, 2 Nephi 32:2–5 - D&C 28:15, D&C 52:3–4 - What should I say? - 2 Nephi 33:1, Alma 5:43–46, Alma 11:22, Helaman 5:18, Helaman 13:3–5 - D&C 33:8–10, D&C 50:13–22, D&C 68:1–4, D&C 75:3–11, D&C 100:5–8 - Matthew 10:19–20, Mark 13:11, 1 Corinthians 2:4–5...12–13, Exodus 4:10–12 - How do I adapt my teaching to the needs of my investigators? - Alma 12:7, Alma 41:1 - 3 Nephi 17:2–3, D&C 71:1, D&C 84:85 - Which scriptures should I use and how should I use them? - Mosiah 18:19-20, D&C 32:4, D&C 71:1 - Mosiah 27:35, D&C 42:11-17, D&C 80:4 = D&C 18:32-36, D&C 68:1-4, Luke 24:13-32 ## A Word of Caution (Page 112) As you pray for inspiration, you should also confirm your feelings. For example, compare your decisions with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets. Be certain that the feelings are consistent with the assignment you have; for example, you will not receive revelation to tell a local bishop how he should perform in his calling. Discuss your decisions and conclusions with your companion, your district leader, or your mission president when appropriate. President Howard W. Hunter offered this counsel: “Let me offer a word of caution. . . . I think if we are not careful . . . , we may begin to try to counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means. I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit. Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” (The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter, 184). The Spirit of the Lord always edifies. Revelation and spiritual experiences are sacred. They should be kept private and discussed only in appropriate situations. As a missionary, you may be more aware of spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life. Resist the temptation to talk freely about these experiences. President Boyd K. Packer counseled: “I have learned that strong, impressive spiritual experiences do not come to us very frequently. And when they do, they are generally for our own edification, instruction, or correction. Unless we are called by proper authority to do so, they do not position us to counsel or to correct others. “I have come to believe also that it is not wise to continually talk of unusual spiritual experiences. They are to be guarded with care and shared only when the Spirit itself prompts you to use them to the blessing of others” (Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). “If worthy, we are entitled to receive revelations for ourselves, parents for their children, and members of the Church in their callings. But the right of revelation for others does not extend beyond our own stewardship.” – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “COMMUNION WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT,” ENSIGN, MAR. 2002, 4. #### Scripture Study (Page 113) Relying on the Spirit is so important that the Lord warns us very strongly not to deny or quench the Spirit. What do you learn from the following passages of scripture? - Jacob 6:8–9 3 Nephi 29:5–6 - Mormon 9:7–9 Moroni 10:7–8 - D&C 11:25–26 1 Thessalonians 5:19–20 #### Remember This (Page 113) - Pray with faith that your prayers will be answered. - Learn to understand, recognize, and follow the promptings of the Spirit. - Learn to rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Teach others how to recognize the Spirit. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 114) ### Personal Study (Page 114) - Record your spiritual experiences in your journal. For', '<2-hop>\n\n## How Should You Use the Book of Mormon? (Page 124) Many investigators either do not read the Book of Mormon or do not understand what they read. Those who do not read or understand the Book of Mormon will have difficulty receiving a witness that it is true. “Please do not take the Book of Mormon for granted. Pray for a vision of how the Book of Mormon can be used more effectively in your mission. I promise that as you do so, your mind will be enlightened with the direction that you should take.” – ELDER JOSEPH B. WIRTHLIN SEMINAR FOR NEW MISSION PRESIDENTS, 23 JUNE 1999 You can help investigators by reading the Book of Mormon with them. Pray for help as you select passages that address their concerns and problems. You may read with them as part of a teaching appointment or during a follow-up visit. You can also arrange for members to read with investigators. Some particularly important passages include the title page, the introduction (especially the last two paragraphs), and Moroni 10:3–5. These passages help investigators understand how to gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon. Encourage them to read the Book of Mormon from the beginning, including the testimonies of the three and eight witnesses and the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. As you read together, pray that the Holy Ghost will testify to the investigators that the Book of Mormon is true. Read and discuss short passages (such as 1 Nephi 3:7 or Mosiah 2:17) and longer passages or complete chapters (such as 2 Nephi 31, Alma 7, or 3 Nephi 18). When you read with investigators, stop occasionally and discuss what you read. Point out key messages or important doctrines to look for as you read with them. Share appropriate insights, feelings, testimonies, and personal experiences. Help others feel the spiritual power of the Book of Mormon. In this way you can teach them true doctrine directly from the Book of Mormon. Continue this practice in subsequent visits so that the people you teach can develop the ability to read and pray on their own. Teach principles and doctrines using the words and phrases of Book of Mormon prophets. Explain the background and context of a passage. Explain unfamiliar words and phrases. “Liken” to yourself and your investigators what you have read by finding applications that are relevant to you personally and to your investigators (see 1 Nephi 19:23). To “liken” is to create a mental bridge between understanding the doctrine and living the doctrine. To read sincerely, with real intent, you and those you teach must be willing to act on the doctrine, to incorporate it into your daily lives, and, as necessary, to repent. By living the doctrine, you will gain an assurance that it is true. For example, you might say to an investigator: - “Nephi, like you, was faced with a difficult challenge. But as he exercised faith to ‘go and do’ what the Lord commanded him, he was able to succeed. (Read 1 Nephi 3:7.) I know that God will prepare a way for you to live the Word of Wisdom.” - “John, it is good that you want to be free from the guilt you feel. Just as the Savior promised the Nephites, if you repent, are baptized, and receive the Holy Ghost, you will be ‘guiltless before [the] Father.’ ” (Read 3 Nephi 27:16.) Rely on the promise in Moroni 10:3–5. Every person who sincerely reads and prays about this book can know with certainty of its truthfulness by the power of the Holy Ghost. Do all you can to help investigators: - Read the Book of Mormon and ponder its message concerning Jesus Christ. - Pray to God with faith in Jesus Christ to receive a testimony that the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration. - Pray sincerely and have real intent, which means that they intend to act on the answer they receive from God. You too should apply this promise regularly to strengthen and renew your own testimony of the Book of Mormon. This renewed testimony will help you maintain a firm confidence that anyone who applies this promise will receive the answer. #']","In the context provided, 1 Nephi 4:6 highlights the significance of relying on the Spirit when facing challenges, such as Nephi's decision to go up against Laban. The broader context emphasizes that missionaries should depend on the Spirit rather than their own talents, trusting it to guide their actions, words, and plans. By applying the principle from 1 Nephi 4:6—trusting in the Lord’s guidance—missionaries can effectively teach, adapt their lessons, and make decisions that align with divine direction, thereby strengthening their efforts and testimonies.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does Adam's role relate to our spiritual progress and the plan of salvation?,"['<1-hop>\n\ngreatest gifts to His children. Our eternal progression depends on how we use this gift. We must choose whether to follow Jesus Christ or follow Satan. We are physically separated from God during life on earth, but He wants every one of His children to find peace in this life and a fulness of joy in His presence after this life. He wants us to become like Him. #### Scripture Study (Page 63) - **Children of God** - D&C 93:29, Acts 17:29, Hebrews 12:9 - **Purpose** - Moses 1:39, and John 17:3 - **Premortal Life** - D&C 138:53–56, Moses 3:5, Abraham 3:22–26, Jeremiah 1:5, and Topical Guide, “Man, Antemortal Existence of” > Lesson Two: Second Principle ## The Creation (Page 63) Under the direction of the Father, Jesus Christ created the earth as a place for us to live and gain experience. In order to progress and become like God, each of us had to obtain a body and be tested during a time of probation on the earth. While on the earth we are out of God’s physical presence. We do not remember our pre-earth life. We must walk by faith rather than by sight. #### Scripture Study (Page 63) - 1 Nephi 17:36, Alma 30:44, D&C 88:41–47 - Moses 2:1, Moses 6:63, Abraham 3:24–25 - JST, John 1:1–3 2, Corinthians 5:6–7 > Lesson Two: Third Principle ## Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve (Page 63) Adam and Eve were the first of God’s children to come to the earth. God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were created in God’s image, with bodies of flesh and bones. While Adam and Eve were in the garden, they were still in God’s presence and could have lived forever. They lived in innocence, and God provided for their needs. In the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam and Eve their agency. He commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Obeying this commandment meant that they could remain in the garden, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality. They could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain. Satan tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and they chose to do so. This was part of God’s plan. Because of this choice, they were cast from the garden and out of God’s physical presence. This event is called the Fall. Separation from God’s presence is spiritual death. Adam and Eve became mortal—subject to physical death, or separation of the body and spirit. They could now experience disease and all types of suffering. They had moral agency or the ability to choose between good and evil. This made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin. In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God’s spirit children could come to earth, obtain physical bodies, and be tested. Only in this way could God’s children progress and become like Him. ### Teaching about the Fall (Page 64) When first teaching this doctrine, do not teach everything you know about it. Explain very simply that God chose two of His children, Adam and Eve, to become the first parents on earth. After their transgression they were subject to both sin and death. By themselves they could not return to live with Heavenly Father. The Lord spoke to Adam and taught him the plan of salvation and redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ. By following that plan, Adam and his family could have joy in this life and return to live with God (see Alma 18:36; 22:12–14). #### Scripture Study (Page 64) - In the Garden: 2 Nephi 2, Moses 2:26–31, Moses 3:15–17, Moses 5:11, Genesis 1:26–31, Genesis 2:15–17 - The Fall: 2 Nephi 2:25, Alma 12:22–34, Moses 4, Moses 5:10–12, Genesis 3 > Lesson Two: Fourth Principle ## Our Life on Earth (Page 64) Life on earth is an opportunity and a blessing. Our purpose in this life is to have joy and prepare to return to God’s presence. In mortality we live in a condition where we are subject to both physical and spiritual death. God has a perfect, glorified, immortal body of flesh and bones. To become like God and return to His presence, we too must have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones. However, because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, every person on earth has an imperfect, mortal body and will eventually die. If not for the Savior Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father. Along with physical death, sin is a major obstacle that keeps us from becoming like our Father in Heaven and returning to His presence. In our mortal condition we often yield to temptation, break God’s commandments, and sin. During our life on earth each of us makes mistakes. Although it sometimes appears otherwise, sin always leads to unhappiness. Sin causes feelings of guilt and shame. Because of our sins, we are unable to return to live with Heavenly Father unless we are first forgiven and cleansed. While we are in mortality, we have experiences that bring us happiness. We also have experiences that bring us pain and sorrow, some of which is caused by the sinful acts of others. These experiences provide us opportunities to learn and to grow, to distinguish good from evil, and to make choices. God influences us to do good; Satan tempts us to commit sin. As with physical death, we cannot overcome the effects of sin by ourselves. We are helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ. #### Scripture Study (Page 65) - Probation or Testing Period: 2 Nephi 2:21, 2 Nephi 9:27, Mosiah 3:19, Alma 12:21–24, Alma 34:31–35, Alma 42:2–10, Abraham 3:25–26 - Choice: 2 Nephi 2:26–29, Joshua 24:15, For the', '<2-hop>\n\n### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 69) The plan of salvation teaches us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. It maps our eternal journey through premortality, mortal life, death, resurrection, and to our life in the eternities. The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him. The plan focuses on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ in overcoming the effects of the Fall and making eternal life possible for us.

It gives us hope and helps us find peace, joy, and happiness. It tells us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. God is our Father, and He loves us. We are His children. We are part of His family, and we lived with Him before we were born on this earth. He has a plan of happiness that makes it possible for us to return to His presence after this life. Our progress depends on how we use our God-given agency, or ability to choose. As part of that plan, the Fall of Adam made it possible for us to come to earth, gain a physical body, have experience, and have families of our own. But the Fall also brought physical death, which is separation of the spirit from the body, and spiritual death, which is separation from God. Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan. Christ’s atoning sacrifice overcame the effects of both physical and spiritual death. We will all be resurrected and will live forever with physical bodies free of pain and sickness. Christ also made it possible to overcome spiritual death. As we live His gospel He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. As part of God’s merciful plan, we will all suffer a physical death. Our spirits will be separated from our bodies and will live for a time in the spirit world. We will then be resurrected with an immortal body, an eternal union of our body and spirit. We will be judged according to our works and desires. Those who have lived the gospel will receive our Father in Heaven’s greatest gift, the gift of eternal life in His presence. Our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love to reveal His plan of happiness. We learn about this wonderful plan in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about.

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

Will', '<2-hop>\n\nand His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. #### Scripture Study (Page 20) What is the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ? - Read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27:13–22 for answers to the question.']","The first hop explains that by applying principles like faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes, which help us be forgiven of our sins.

First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve: - Make sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. - Develop faith in Christ. - Repent of transgressions. - Live the principles of moral worthiness. - Live the Word of Wisdom. - Commit to pay tithing. - Receive all the missionary lessons [lessons 1–4 on the Teaching Record and associated commitments]. - Meet the bishop or branch president. - Attend several sacrament meetings. (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002) When an investigator has set a firm baptismal date, schedule when you will complete all the events that lead to baptism and confirmation as listed in your daily planner. Carefully review the Teaching Record to ensure that you have taught the basic doctrines and that the candidates are prepared to address each question in the baptismal interview. Review this schedule with the person in your next meeting. If possible, the person should attend a baptismal service prior to his or her own baptism. If you feel that the person you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule an interview until the investigator meets the standards. If the candidate is a minor, ensure that the parents or guardians have given permission, preferably in writing, for him or her to be baptized. As you help people prepare for their baptismal interview, talk to them about the purpose of the interview. Teach them and bear testimony about the sacredness of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Explain that you want to make sure they understand the principles you have taught and the covenant they will make. Also explain that the interview is an opportunity for them to witness before the Lord’s representative that they are ready for these sacred ordinances. As they keep the covenant made at baptism and confirmation, they will receive a remission of sins. Share the questions the interviewer will ask about their belief in important doctrines, their repentance of past sins, and their willingness to covenant to obey Jesus Christ throughout their lives. Emphasize that baptism by water is incomplete without confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 219) - Read each of the following passages, and make a summary list of the scriptural qualifications for baptism and confirmation. - 2 Nephi 9:23, 31:4-13; 3 Nephi 27:13-21, D&C 20:37 - Mosiah 18:8-10, Moroni 6:1-4, D&C 22 - Alma 7:14-15, Moroni 8:25-26, Acts 2:37-39 - In baptismal interviews, candidates are asked whether they are willing to take upon themselves the name of Christ. What can you do to help them understand this question? As you ponder this question, study the following scriptures: - Mosiah 4–5, Mosiah 18:1–11, Mosiah 26:18, 21–27; 3 Nephi 27:1–10 You may also want to look for other passages that help you understand this principle. ## How to Conduct the Interview (Page 219) The person conducting the interview should use the baptismal interview questions with the guidance of the Spirit to determine whether the baptismal candidate meets the qualifications described in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. He should also adapt the questions to the age and maturity of the candidate. If a candidate does not qualify according to the baptismal interview questions, the baptism and confirmation should be postponed. The investigator should receive additional teaching by the full-time missionaries and fellowshipping from ward members. The district leader or zone leader who conducts the interview should: - Hold the interview in a comfortable, private place, conducive to feeling the Spirit of the Lord. The interviewer’s companion should be nearby. - Open with prayer. - Help the candidate feel comfortable. - Make the interview a spiritually uplifting experience. - Make sure that the candidate understands the purpose of the interview. - Ask the baptismal interview questions. Use follow-up questions to get a feeling for the strength of the person’s testimony and the sincerity of the person’s repentance. - Answer the candidate’s questions. - Invite the person to bear testimony and express his or her feelings. - If the person has challenges with testimony or worthiness, explain that it would be best to postpone the baptism until he or she is better prepared. #### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 220) 1.

You have been called by revelation through God’s chosen servants to assist the Apostles in this great work of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world in order to make disciples of all nations. When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6). To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you. Heavenly Father loves you, and He will help you to love and bless His children wherever you serve. He will empower you and the people you serve, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to be truly “converted unto the Lord” (Alma 23:6). These missionary standards are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They will help protect you physically, spiritually, and emotionally and help you be the disciple Jesus Christ needs you to become. If you have questions about a standard, prayerfully ask the Lord to help you understand its importance, and then if needed, ask your companion, your young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders for help. Regularly study these standards with your companion and strive to obey them. We congratulate you for accepting a call to serve a full-time mission, and we pray you will find true peace and joy in serving the Lord Jesus Christ.

How does Romans relate to repentance and baptism in the context of developing Christlike qualities and obeying God?,"['<1-hop>\n\nfrom our sins and do them no more. We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper. Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son. Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions. In addition, we should continually improve—to develop Christlike qualities, to grow in knowledge, and to serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior expects of us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily. #### Scripture Study (Page 77) - We All Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:7–8 - Repentance: Alma 34:8–17, D&C 58:42–43, D&C 61:2, 2 Corinthians 7:9–10, Bible Dictionary, “Repentance” - Redemption and Forgiveness: Helaman 5:10–11 - Mercy Claims the Penitent: Alma 12:32–35, Alma 42:13, 21–24, D&C 18:10–13 > Lesson Three: Fourth Principle ## Baptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. #### Before Baptism (Page 78) “Ensure that [investigators] have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. Investigators should live the principles of moral worthiness, the Word of Wisdom, and commit to pay tithing. If missionaries feel additional preparation is needed, they should postpone baptism until the investigator meets the standard. *“Before baptism each investigator should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch president, and attend several sacrament meetings”* (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). #### Scripture Study (Page 79) - Christ’s Example: 2 Nephi 31:4–18, Matthew 3:13–17 - The Baptismal Covenant: Mosiah 5:8–10, Mosiah 18:8–10, D&C 20:37 - Qualifications', '<2-hop>\n\nStrength of Youth, “Agency and Accountability” - Good and Evil: Moroni 7:12–19 - Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:8–10, 1 John 3:4 - The Unclean Cannot Be with God: 1 Nephi 10:20–21, Alma 41:10–11, 3 Nephi 27:19, Moses 6:57 > Lesson Two: Fifth Principle ## The Atonement (page 65) Before the world was organized, our Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ made it possible for us to overcome the effects of the Fall. All of the prophets since the world began have testified of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer. We will all suffer physical death, but Jesus Christ overcame the obstacle of physical death for us. When He died on the cross, His spirit became separated from His body. On the third day, His spirit and His body were reunited eternally, never to be separated again. He appeared to many people, showing them that He had an immortal body of flesh and bone. The reuniting of body and spirit is called resurrection and is a gift promised to each of us. Because of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, we will all be resurrected regardless of whether we have done good or evil in this life. We will have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones that will never again be subject to disease, pain, or death. The resurrection makes it possible to return to God’s presence to be judged but does not guarantee that we will be able to live in His presence. To receive that blessing, we must also be cleansed from sin. God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to overcome the obstacle of sin in addition to the obstacle of physical death. We are not responsible for the Fall of Adam and Eve, but we are responsible for our own sins. God cannot look on sin with any degree of allowance, and sin prevents us from living in His presence. Only through the Savior’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin so that we can live with God again. This is possible through exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. To fulfill the plan of salvation, Christ paid the penalty for our sins. He alone was able to do that. He was called and prepared in pre-earth life. He was the literal Son of God in the flesh. He was sinless and completely obedient to His Father. Though tempted, He never gave in to temptation. When the Father asked His Beloved Son to pay the price of the world’s sins, Jesus was prepared and willing. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and His suffering and death on the cross, and it ended with His Resurrection. Though He suffered beyond comprehension—so much so that He bled from every pore and asked whether it were possible that this burden be lifted from Him—He submitted to the Father’s will in a supreme expression of love for His Father and for us. This triumph of Jesus Christ over spiritual death by His suffering and over physical death by His Resurrection is called the Atonement. Christ promises to forgive our sins on the condition that we accept Him by exercising faith in Him, repenting, receiving baptism by immersion, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and striving faithfully to keep His commandments to the end of our lives. Through continuing repentance, we may obtain forgiveness and be cleansed of our sins by the power of the Holy Ghost. We are relieved of the burden of guilt and shame, and through Jesus Christ we become worthy to return to the presence of God. As we rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In paying the penalty for our sins, Jesus did not, however, eliminate our personal responsibility.

At death our spirits go to the spirit world. Death does not change our personality or our desires for good or evil. Those who chose to obey God in this life live in a state of happiness, peace, and rest from troubles and care. Those who chose not to obey in this life and did not repent live in a state of unhappiness. In the spirit world the gospel is preached to those who did not obey the gospel or have the opportunity to hear it while on earth.

The context explains that sincere repentance brings forgiveness, peace, and spiritual growth, which are essential for developing Christlike qualities. Additionally, Romans 8:14–17 discusses becoming children of God through faith and baptism, symbolizing a new life.

He is a member of a mission presidency with two counselors. Counselors in the mission presidency, like counselors in a stake presidency or bishopric, help organize and assist in the work. Counselors in the mission presidency do not address matters of missionary worthiness. > 2.1.3 ### Mission Leadership Organization Your mission president uses revelation and priesthood keys to organize the work. He assigns young missionaries to be trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants. Assistants, office missionaries, and other missionaries do not make missionary leadership assignments or assign the areas where you serve. However, the mission president may counsel with his wife or his assistants about missionary assignments. Your mission leaders and the assistants, zone leaders, and sister training leaders are members of the mission leadership council. These leaders counsel about meeting the needs of the missionaries and make plans to help the mission progress and to move the work forward. > 2.1.4 ### Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities Young missionary leaders, like all missionaries, follow the counsel of Jesus Christ to “serve [God] with all [their] heart, might, mind and strength” and to “remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence” (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2, 6). Leadership assignments do not indicate special recognition or advancement or reflect the worth of a missionary. Young missionary leaders have the responsibility to: - Find, teach, baptize, and fellowship people. - Set an example of missionary standards for behavior (see 3.0). - Train other missionaries and lead companion exchanges (see 2.3.1). - Share information and direction from the mission leadership council with the missionaries they lead. - Love and befriend other missionaries. Help them recognize the value of their efforts. - Listen to other missionaries’ concerns. Give support and counsel. - Correct other missionaries kindly and privately, as needed, followed by “an increase of love” (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–43). - Work closely with local leaders and members. Like all missionaries, elders and sisters with leadership assignments should practice Christlike leadership. If the conduct of any missionary, including young missionary leaders, seems inconsistent with the commandments and missionary standards, discuss the issue with the missionary. If the issue is not then resolved, share your concerns with your young missionary leaders or mission president and not with other missionaries, members, or friends. For more information about the specific assignments and responsibilities of young missionary leaders (trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants to the president), see section 7.1, “Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities.” > 2.1.5 ### Personal Responsibilities “Magnify [your] office unto the Lord” (Jacob 1:19), become spiritually self-reliant, and “act for [yourself]” (2 Nephi 2:16) by trusting the Lord and following the Spirit. When you have questions or concerns: Apply the teaching to “study it out in your mind; then … ask me if it be right” (Doctrine and Covenants 9:8). Seek guidance through personal revelation; prayer; and study of the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets, and these standards. If you need additional help after applying these principles, ask your companion or young missionary leaders. Often, they can help you find answers to your questions and resolve your concerns. If not, reach out to either of your mission leaders, your parents, or your home priesthood leaders. Please do not contact Church headquarters. If you do, you will be referred back to your mission president. Talk with your mission president about worthiness issues. Talk with either of your mission leaders about immediate safety concerns, including assault or abuse, or other issues that cannot be resolved with other missionaries. There may be times during your mission when you find it difficult to focus on your work due to current challenges, personal or family matters, or even past experiences. That is understandable. Do not hesitate to share your concerns with your companion, young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders and to reach out for support. Remember the Savior’s invitation: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen” (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36–37). > 2.2 ## Companions The Lord calls missionaries to preach His gospel in companionships. “Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands” (Doctrine and Covenants 52:10). You will work with different companions throughout your mission. Companions: Become united in the work and together testify of Jesus Christ. Support each other’s spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. Try to keep each other safe. Are accountable to each other in keeping missionary standards. > 2.2.1 ### Supporting Each Other Companions should help each other learn, grow, and develop Christlike attributes (see Doctrine and Covenants 4 and “How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 6). Learning patience and love, practicing forgiveness, and accepting differences in personalities will bless you throughout your life. As companions: - Love, respect, and strengthen each other. - Study together every day and pray together frequently throughout the day. - Be humble and recognize each other’s strengths. - Treat each other as you would like to be treated. - Avoid criticism and contention. - Avoid speaking negatively about each other to other missionaries, Church members, or family and friends at home. If you notice any inappropriate situation or behavior, discuss it with your companion. If the matter is not resolved or if your companion is being abusive, have the courage and love for your companion to ask your mission president for help (see 3.9.2). > 2.2.2 ### Staying Together Staying with your companion will help provide protection from physical and spiritual dangers, false accusations, and loneliness.

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

They support the Savior's work by setting an example, working closely with local leaders and members, and helping fellow missionaries stay aligned with missionary standards.

How does James 1:5 relate to the concept of repentance and seeking spiritual knowledge as emphasized in the context of gospel study and divine guidance?,"['<1-hop>\n\nNephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away', '<2-hop>\n\nnew members. > Beginning of Chapter 2 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach? (Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 32) Read Joseph Smith—History 1:11–13. Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.” – PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER “LITTLE CHILDREN,” ENSIGN, NOV. 1986, 17 #### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ## Studying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain']","James 1:5 encourages individuals to ask God for wisdom, which aligns with the principles of repentance and seeking spiritual knowledge highlighted in the context. The context emphasizes that effective gospel study begins with prayer and reliance on the Holy Ghost to gain understanding. Just as James 1:5 invites us to seek divine wisdom, the context shows that studying the gospel and asking for the Holy Ghost's guidance help us understand God's commandments, repent sincerely, and develop faith in Jesus Christ. Both emphasize that divine guidance and humility are essential for spiritual growth, repentance, and acquiring the knowledge necessary to live in harmony with God's will.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does 2 Corinthians 4 relate to 2 Corinthians, and how can it help missionaries understand spiritual strength in their work?","['<1-hop>\n\nPhysical Well-Being > 4.0 ## Introduction Missionary work requires physical and emotional commitment. The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion.

The Bible teaches the following about the law of witnesses: “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” (2 Corinthians 13:1). In harmony with this law, both the Book of Mormon and the Bible testify of Jesus Christ. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 120) Find cross-references on the following topics in the Book of Mormon and Bible. Examples are given in parentheses after each topic. Add passages and topics of your own. - Prophets (Amos 3:7 and Jacob 4:4–6) - Apostasy (2 Timothy 4:3–4 and 2 Nephi 28) - Restoration (Acts 3:19–21 and 1 Nephi 13:34–42) - Children of God (Acts 17:29 and 1 Nephi 17:36) #### Scripture Study (Page 120) - What does the Bible say about the Book of Mormon? - John 10:16, Isaiah 29:4, 11–18, Ezekiel 37:15–17, Bible Dictionary, “Ephraim, Stick of” - What does the Book of Mormon say about the Bible? -1 Nephi 13:20–29, 40–41, 2 Nephi 29:3–14, 3 Nephi 23:1, Mormon 7:8–9 - In what ways do both books serve as testaments of Christ? - 2 Nephi 29:8, John 20:31, Acts 10:43 ## The Book of Mormon Answers Questions of the Soul (Page 121) President Ezra Taft Benson said that missionaries “need to show how [the Book of Mormon] answers the great questions of the soul” (“Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, Nov. 1988, 5). “The great questions of the soul” may include such questions as these: Is there really a God? Did I exist before I was born? Will I live after I die? What is the purpose of life? Is Jesus really the Savior? Other questions may focus on more temporal needs: How can I improve my relationship with my spouse? How can I help my teenagers avoid drugs or immorality? How can I find work to support my family? The gospel of Jesus Christ helps us answer both kinds of questions. As we gain faith that the Book of Mormon is true, we can begin to answer questions about the purpose of life and the hope of eternal life. The Book of Mormon describes the plan of happiness, which gives meaning and perspective to life. Answers to questions such as the following are clearly taught in the Book of Mormon. - Is there a God? (Alma 22) - What does Jesus Christ expect of me? (2 Nephi 9) - How can a belief in Jesus Christ help me? (Alma 36) - Is there life after death? (Alma 40) - What is the purpose of life? (Alma 34) - Why does God allow evil and suffering to occur? (2 Nephi 2; Alma 14:9–11; 60:13) - Does my infant need to be baptized? (Moroni 8) - Does God know me? (Alma 5:38, 58) - Does God answer prayers? (Enos 1) - How can I find peace and joy? (Mosiah 2, 4) - How can my family be happier and more united? (Mosiah 2) - How can I balance my family and career? (3 Nephi 13) - How can I strengthen my relationship with my spouse? (3 Nephi 14) - How can I avoid the evils that threaten my family? (Alma 39) - How can I avoid sin? (Helaman 5) As we read the Book of Mormon with the guidance of the Spirit, it helps us answer personal questions. It teaches that prayer and revelation are the key to solving particular problems. It helps us have faith that God will answer our prayers. The Book of Mormon also helps us understand that God’s commandments are not a restrictive list of dos and don’ts but guideposts to a happy, abundant life. As we begin to understand that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are the way to the abundant life, we will appreciate that these principles help answer any question and fill any need. For example, we understand that repentance, forgiveness, and the covenant to serve others are essential in improving relationships with our spouses. We see that faith in Christ, accepting and keeping covenants, and following the promptings of the Spirit can help teenagers avoid the powerful temptations that surround them. The gospel can resolve almost any question or need. This is why you are to “teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel” (D&C 42:12). “In a world ever more dangerous . . . the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ has the nourishing power to heal starving spirits of the world. – PRESIDENT BOYD K.

Find verses in the Book of Mormon to answer these questions. Write the answers in your study journal, and use them as you teach. ## The Book of Mormon Draws People Nearer to God (Page 122) Regarding the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). The Book of Mormon is a springboard to testimony and personal revelation. Use the Book of Mormon to help people have spiritual experiences, especially a witness from the Holy Ghost that the book itself is true. By consistently inviting people to live the principles found in the Book of Mormon, you help them develop faith in Jesus Christ and draw nearer to God. President Gordon B. Hinckley declared: “Those who have read [the Book of Mormon] prayerfully, be they rich or poor, learned or unlearned, have grown under its power. . . . Without reservation I promise you that if you will']","2 Corinthians 4 emphasizes themes of spiritual resilience and faith in Christ, which relate to the broader teachings in 2 Corinthians about enduring hardships and relying on God's power. The chapter teaches that our light affliction is temporary and that through faith in Jesus Christ, we can overcome challenges and draw nearer to God. For missionaries, understanding these principles can strengthen their spiritual well-being and help them persevere in their service, knowing that God's support sustains them through difficulties, as highlighted in both the chapter and the overall message of 2 Corinthians.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the doctrine of Romans support the understanding of Christ’s Atonement and the importance of faith and repentance in returning to God's presence, as explained in the context of the gospel principles?","['<1-hop>\n\nNephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away', '<2-hop>\n\nfor Baptism: 2 Nephi 9:23, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 7:14–15, 3 Nephi 11:23–27, Moroni 6:1–4, D&C 20:37, Acts 2:37–39 - The Lord Institutes the Sacrament: 3 Nephi 18:1–18, Luke 22:15–20 - Promised Blessings of Baptism: Mosiah 4:11–12, 26, Moroni 8:25–26, John 3:5, Romans 6:4 - The Sacrament Prayers: Moroni 4 and 5, D&C 20:75–79 - Partaking of the Sacrament: D&C 27:2, 1 Corinthians 11:23–29 - Necessity for Authority: D&C 22, Hebrews 5:4 > Lesson Three: Fifth Principle ## The Gift of the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan.

In the context provided, the principles of faith and repentance are central to returning to God's presence, as Christ’s Atonement satisfies justice and offers mercy to those who repent. Romans underscores that faith in Christ is essential for salvation, aligning with the teachings that through faith, we accept His Atonement, repent of our sins, and rely on His grace to be forgiven. This connection reinforces that understanding Christ’s Atonement, as explained in the context, is vital for overcoming sin and returning to dwell with Heavenly Father, emphasizing that faith and repentance are the means by which we access His mercy and achieve eternal life.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the Spirit influence our ability to recognize the truth of the Book of Mormon and strengthen our testimony of Jesus Christ, especially when relying on the Spirit to guide us in our missionary efforts and personal study?","['<1-hop>\n\nfor if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church.

The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach investigators. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach investigators. | Missionary Lesson | Doctrines | References | | --- | --- | --- | | The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ | Apostasy, Restoration, Joseph Smith, priesthood authority | 1 Nephi 12-14 2 Nephi 3; 26-29 Mosiah 18 | | The Plan of Salvation | The “great plan of the eternal God,” including the Fall of Adam, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the Judgment | 2 Nephi 2; 9 Mosiah 3; 15 Alma 12; 40-42 | | The Gospel of Jesus Christ | Faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end | 2 Nephi 31-32 3 Nephi 11; 27 | | The Commandments; Laws and Ordinances | Ordinances such as baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament | 3 Nephi 11:22-28; 18 Moroni 2-6 | #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 119) Write answers to the following questions in your study journal: - How has your study of the Book of Mormon influenced your testimony of Jesus Christ? - How can you use the Book of Mormon to help strengthen others’ testimonies? #### Scripture study (Page 119) - What does the Savior say about the Book of Mormon? (Page 119) - D&C 1:29, D&C 42:12, D&C 17:6 ## The Book of Mormon Testifies of Christ (Page 119) A central purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ (see title page of the Book of Mormon). It testifies of Christ by affirming the reality of His life, mission, and power. It teaches true doctrine concerning the Atonement—the foundation for the plan of salvation. Several of those whose writings are preserved in the Book of Mormon saw Christ personally. The brother of Jared, Nephi, and Jacob saw the premortal Christ. Mormon and Moroni saw the risen Christ. In addition, multitudes were present during the Savior’s brief but powerful ministry among the Nephites (see 3 Nephi 11–28). Those who know little or nothing about the Savior will come to know Him by reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon. The testimony of the Book of Mormon confirms the testimony of the Bible that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior of the world. As you teach the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you will testify often about the Savior and Redeemer of the world. By the power of the Holy Ghost, you will add your living witness of the truthfulness of this message. #### Scripture Study (Page 119) - What reasons did the Book of Mormon prophets give for writing their records? | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 Nephi 6:4-6 | 2 Nephi 33:13-15 | Words of Mormon 1:3-8 | | 1 Nephi 9:3-5 | Jacob 1:4-7 | Alma 37:2, 14 | | 2 Nephi 4:15-16 | Jacob 4:1-6, 12 | 3 Nephi 5:14-15 | | 2 Nephi 25:23-29 | Enos 1:13 | Mormon 8:35 | | 2 Nephi 26:15-16 | Jarom 1:2 | D&C 3:16-20 | | 2 Nephi 29:11-14 | Omni 1:25-26 | D&C 10:46-48 | ## The Book of Mormon and the Bible Support Each Other (Page 120) People’s beliefs about the Bible vary widely. Some believe that the Bible is absolutely perfect, without error, and that it is all we need to be saved. Others think the Bible is literature worth studying, but they deny that it is evidence of Christ’s divinity and miracles or direct revelation from God. Some choose to ignore the Bible, and others have never seen the Bible or had a chance to read it. Latter-day Saints “believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly” (Articles of Faith 1:8). Far from competing with the Bible, the Book of Mormon supports it, exhorts us to read it, and testifies of the truthfulness of its message. You should use the Book of Mormon and the Bible to support one another. The Book of Mormon speaks of the ancient covenants God made with His children; the Bible tells of great prophets who also received these covenants by faith. The Book of Mormon testifies of Christ and His Atonement; the Bible provides the account of His birth, ministry, death, Atonement, and Resurrection. Thus, the Bible and Book of Mormon complement and enrich each other. The LDS edition of the King James Version of the Bible and the Book of Mormon have cross-references and study aids that make the stick of Judah (the Bible) and the stick of Joseph (the Book of Mormon) one in our hands (see Ezekiel 37:15–17; see also 1 Nephi 13:34–41; 2 Nephi 3:12; 29:8). Give priority to Book of Mormon passages when you teach, but also show how the Book of Mormon and the Bible teach the same principles. Use the Book of Mormon to clarify and explain Bible passages. For example, the New Testament states that Christ was baptized to “fulfil all righteousness” (Matthew 3:14–15). The Book of Mormon explains what it means to fulfill all righteousness (see 2 Nephi', '<2-hop>\n\nyourself and for others. - Rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Be exactly obedient. • Study the language of your mission each day. - Plan every day and focus on the key indicators. - Work effectively all day, every day. - Ask for referrals from everyone! - Teach when you find; find when you teach. - Read the Book of Mormon with those you teach. - Teach people that an important way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. - Contact every investigator daily. - Bear testimony frequently. - Have a member at every lesson possible. - Always set specific dates and times for the next lesson. - Invite all investigators to baptismal services. - After each lesson, provide investigators with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. - Build relationships with members by serving them and working with the leadership of the ward. - Help ward leaders with retention and activation activities. - Help everyone you teach make commitments that will bring about repentance and will strengthen their faith in the Savior. - Love the Lord and serve Him the very best you can.']","The context emphasizes that the Spirit is a powerful resource in confirming the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, which testifies of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. It states that millions have testified that they have the witness of the Spirit confirming the Book's truth, and that the Spirit helps individuals recognize the Savior and His teachings. Additionally, the second context highlights that relying on the Spirit is essential for missionaries to know where to go, what to say, and how to teach effectively. The Spirit guides missionaries and individuals alike in their efforts to strengthen faith, make commitments, and recognize spiritual truths. Therefore, the Spirit influences our ability to discern the truth of the Book of Mormon and to strengthen our testimony of Jesus Christ by providing personal confirmation and divine guidance in both personal study and missionary service.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"Why is Matthew important for understanding the Great Apostasy and the need for restoration, and how does it relate to Matthew's teachings about priesthood authority and apostasy?","['<1-hop>\n\n## The Great Apostasy (Page 49) After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept the doctrines of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the doctrines were corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost. Without revelation and priesthood authority, people relied on human wisdom to interpret the scriptures and the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. False ideas were taught as truth. Much of the knowledge of the true character and nature of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was lost. The doctrines of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or forgotten. The priesthood authority given to Christ’s Apostles was no longer present on the earth. This apostasy eventually led to the emergence of many churches. After centuries of spiritual darkness, truth-seeking men and women protested against current religious practices. They recognized that many of the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel had been changed or lost. They sought for greater spiritual light, and many spoke of the need for a restoration of truth. They did not claim, however, that God had called them to be a prophet. Instead, they tried to reform teachings and practices that they believed had been changed or corrupted. Their efforts led to the organization of many Protestant churches. This Reformation resulted in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the final Restoration. The Savior’s Apostles foretold this universal apostasy. They also foretold that the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church would be restored once more upon the earth. #### Scripture Study (Page 49) Study these scriptures to learn more anout the great apostacy: - 1 Nephi 13, 2 Nephi 26:20–21, 2 Nephi 28, 4 Nephi 1:27, D&C 86:1–3, Matthew 24:9–11, Mark 12:1–9, Acts 3:19–21 - Acts 20:28–30, Galatians 1:6–9, 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 (JST verses 2, 3, 7–9), 1 Timothy 4:1–3, 2 Timothy 4:3–4, 2 Peter 2:1–2, Amos 8:11–12 - Topical Guide: “Apostasy of the Early Christian Church”, True to the Faith, “Apostasy,” pages 13–14 Our Search for Happiness, pages 23–32 Jesus the Christ, chapter 40, “The Long Night of Apostasy” #### The Great Apostasy (Page 50) Investigators must understand that a universal apostasy occurred following the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. If there had been no apostasy, there would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As guided by the Spirit, teach investigators about the Great Apostasy at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. **Key Points** - The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see Ephesians 2:19–20; 4:11–14). These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer upon others the priesthood authority. - People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see Matthew 24:9; 1 Nephi 11:32–34; 2 Nephi 27:5). With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation ceased, and doctrine became corrupted. - Even before the death of the Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. The simple doctrines and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see Isaiah 24:5). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrines from them (1 Nephi 13:26–40). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see 3 John 1:9–10). People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see 2 Timothy 4:3–4). - Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshiped according to the light they possessed and have received answers to their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). - Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy. > Lesson One: Sixth Principle ## The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith (Page 50) When the circumstances were right, Heavenly Father once again reached out to His children in love. He called a young man named Joseph Smith as a prophet. Through him the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth. Joseph Smith lived in the United States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at the time. It was at a time of great religious excitement in the eastern United States. His family members were deeply religious and constantly sought for truth. But many ministers claimed to have the true gospel. Joseph desired “to know which of all the sects was right,” (Joseph Smith—History 1:18). The Bible taught there was “one Lord, one faith, one baptism”', ""<2-hop>\n\nchapter. - Over the course of several weeks, review the Savior’s teachings in the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and 3 Nephi. In your study journal, make a list of the questions He asked. Compare these questions with the questions you typically ask. Read the account of Ammon and King Lamoni in Aima 18 and the account of Aaron in Alma 22:4-18. As you read, identify and describe how Ammon and Aaron: - Followed the Spirit and taught with love. - Began to teach - Adapted their teachings to meet needs. - Bore testimony. - Used the scriptures. - Asked questions, listened, and resolved concerns. - Encouraged those they taught to make commitments. - Ponder the following statements by President Harold B. Lee regarding teaching for understanding. Evaluate how clearly you teach the doctrines of the gospel. Record what you learn in your study journal. “May you stay with the context of the scripture and reduce it to understandable terms” (The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, sel. Clyde J. Williams [1996], 444). “Now you as teachers are not being sent out to teach new doctrine. You're to teach the old doctrines, not so plain that they can just understand, but you must teach the doctrines of the Church so plainly that no one can misunderstand” (The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, 458). ### Companion Study (Page 208) - Review your lesson plan from a recent lesson you have taught. Write one question for each of the major principles outlined in your plan. Then review your questions to see whether they are in harmony with what is taught in this chapter. Next, answer each question as though you were an investigator. Revise your questions as needed. Share your questions with your companion. Together, evaluate your questions. Consider the needs of an investigator you are teaching. Discuss how he or she might answer your questions. Also discuss how these questions may invite the Spirit and help the investigator learn the gospel. - Think of each of your new investigators. Discuss what you can do to help them become a progressing investigator. Write your ideas in your study journal and make plans in your daily planner. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 208) - Invite members or current investigators to your meeting. Explain to the group that you want missionaries to improve their ability to share their important message. Select a lesson and a skill. Have the missionaries teach the members or investigators the lesson you have selected for 20 minutes, focusing on the skill you have identified. Have them switch after 20 minutes. After the missionaries have had an opportunity to teach, bring the group together and have the members and investi- gators tell the missionaries what was most effective and one way they can improve. - Show video examples of missionaries teaching or contacting people. Select a skill and discuss as a group how well the missionaries in the video applied the principles for that skill. - Select a skill or an important aspect of a skill, and identify doctrine or scripture passages that support the skill. Teach the doctrinal foundation of the skill to the missionaries. ### Mission President (Page 208) - Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach. Plan with them how you can participate in the teaching. - Encourage priesthood leaders to accompany missionaries in their teaching visits and provide feedback. - Demonstrate the effective use of scriptures, questions, and listening when teaching missionaries in zone conferences and interviews. > Beginning of chapter 11 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Help People Make and Keep Commitments? (Page 209) #### Consider This (Page 209) - Why should I focus on inviting people to make commitments? - How do commitments relate to conversion? - How can I bear humble testimony? - What blessings can I promise? - Why is it important for me to follow up when people make commitments? ## Extend Commitment Invitations (Page 209) As a missionary you desire the salvation of souls (see Mosiah 28:3). You know that people can come unto Christ and be saved only on conditions of repentance (see D&C 18:10–16). One way to fulfill your desires is to cry repentance (see Alma 5:49; D&C 15:6; 16:6) and boldly invite people to exercise faith unto repentance, to be baptized by water and the Spirit, and to endure faithfully to the end (see 3 Nephi 27:16–20; Mormon 7:10). Commitment is an essential part of repentance. It is the act of obligating oneself to a course of action and then diligently following through on that decision. When people are genuinely committed, they have real intent, meaning that they fully intend to do what they have committed to do. They make an unwavering and earnest decision to change. They become devoted to Christ and dedicate themselves to His gospel. Keeping their commitment is how they “truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins” (D&C 20:37). When you ask for commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting the investigator to repent. One of the best ways to help people make and keep commitments is to extend a commitment invitation. Extending and following up on commitment invitations is vital because: - People become converted as they live the principles they learn (see John 7:17) and feel the Spirit confirm that what they are doing is pleasing to their Father in Heaven. - Repentance and change will help people conquer challenges, rid themselves of shame and guilt, and experience the peace and joy of God’s forgiveness. - Keeping commitments prepares people to make and keep sacred covenants. You can show your love for the people and your faith in God’s promises by following up to help them repent and keep their commitments. The commitments required for baptism are listed in the first four lessons. The commitments related to spiritual progress after baptism and confirmation are listed in lesson 5.""]","Matthew is important because it contains teachings that foretell the challenges the early Christian church would face, including the rejection of Jesus and His apostles, which contributed to the Great Apostasy. Specifically, Matthew 24:9–11 warns of false prophets and teachings that would arise after the apostles' death, leading to the corruption and loss of divine priesthood authority. This aligns with the context of the Great Apostasy described in the first segment, where the death of Jesus Christ and His apostles resulted in the absence of priesthood keys and the distortion of gospel doctrines. The teachings in Matthew highlight the importance of divine authority and the need for a restoration of the gospel, which was fulfilled through Joseph Smith, as the scriptures and context emphasize the necessity of divine messengers to restore priesthood authority and truth that had been lost during the apostasy.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does Matthew 5:6 relate to the importance of studying gospel to get Holy Ghost and follow Jesus?,"['<1-hop>\n\nnew members. > Beginning of Chapter 2 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach? (Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 32) Read Joseph Smith—History 1:11–13. Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.” – PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER “LITTLE CHILDREN,” ENSIGN, NOV. 1986, 17 #### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ## Studying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain', '<2-hop>\n\nfor Baptism: 2 Nephi 9:23, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 7:14–15, 3 Nephi 11:23–27, Moroni 6:1–4, D&C 20:37, Acts 2:37–39 - The Lord Institutes the Sacrament: 3 Nephi 18:1–18, Luke 22:15–20 - Promised Blessings of Baptism: Mosiah 4:11–12, 26, Moroni 8:25–26, John 3:5, Romans 6:4 - The Sacrament Prayers: Moroni 4 and 5, D&C 20:75–79 - Partaking of the Sacrament: D&C 27:2, 1 Corinthians 11:23–29 - Necessity for Authority: D&C 22, Hebrews 5:4 > Lesson Three: Fifth Principle ## The Gift of the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life.

"How do Moroni 10:2 and Moroni 10:8–18 together emphasize the importance of seeking the Holy Ghost and spiritual gifts in missionary work, and how can understanding these scriptures enhance a missionary's ability to teach with the power of the Spirit?","['<1-hop>\n\nGhost,” 704). As a member of the Church, you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost by priesthood authority. This gift entitles you to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as you remain worthy of it. Pray for the Spirit’s guidance, and valiantly follow the promptings you receive. “The gift of the Holy Ghost comes after one repents and becomes worthy. . . . The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ so deeply that no earthly power or authority can separate him from that knowledge."" – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST—A SURE COMPASS,” ENSIGN, APR. 1996, 4 - **The Holy Spirit of Promise.** The Holy Ghost is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise (see D&C 88:3). To be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable to God. The Holy Spirit of Promise testifies to the Father that the saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants associated with them have been kept. Those who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has (see D&C 76:51–60; Ephesians 1:13–14). All covenants and performances must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise if they are to be valid after this life (see D&C 132:7, 18–19, 26). Breaking covenants may remove the sealing. - **Gifts of the Spirit.** The gifts of the Spirit are special spiritual blessings that the Lord gives to worthy individuals for their own benefit and for their use in blessing others. For example, missionaries who must learn a new language may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help in learning a language. Several gifts of the Spirit are described in Moroni 10:8–18; Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33; and 1 Corinthians 12:1–12. These are only some examples of the many gifts of the Spirit. The Lord may bless you in other ways depending on your faithfulness, your needs, and the needs of those you serve. You should desire spiritual gifts and earnestly seek for them (see D&C 46:8; 1 Corinthians 12:31; 14:1, 12). These gifts come by prayer, faith, and works, according to God’s will (see D&C 63:9–12; 84:64–73). #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 106) Read the references below: - Bible Dictionary, “Holy Ghost,” “Light of Christ,” and “Spirit.” - Our Search for Happiness, 84–86, 91–92. - True to the Faith, “Holy Ghost,” 81–84, and “Spiritual Gifts,” 165–67. Write a description of the nature and role of the Holy Ghost. - Read Acts 4:23–33. - How did Peter and John seek spiritual gifts? - How did the Lord answer their prayers? - What can you learn from this experience about your own work? ## The Power of the Spirit in Conversion (Page 106) The power of the Holy Ghost is central to conversion. Strive to understand the doctrine of conversion and also the experience of conversion. President Boyd K. Packer explained the central role of the Spirit in conversion: “When conversion takes place, it is through the power of the Spirit. In order to succeed in missionary work, these three things must occur: “We must understand what an investigator must feel in order to receive conversion. “We must understand how a missionary must feel in order to teach with the converting power of the Spirit. “And then we must understand how a member must feel to succeed in participating in the conversion experience” (mission presidents’ conference, 3 Apr. 1985). The better you understand how investigators, missionaries, and members feel when they receive the witness of the Spirit, the better you will understand your own role, which is to: - Be edified and have your mind enlightened as you search the scriptures and teach the doctrine. - Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear witness. You do this by teaching and testifying of the message of the Restoration. Teach as directed by the Spirit, and testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true. - Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting the message to each person’s needs. - Invite people to act. Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and make and keep covenants. Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke of the power of the Spirit: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed. When individuals . . . feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word. This is how we come to feel the gospel is true” (“Now Is the Time,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 75). The Holy Ghost works in the hearts of people to bring about these changes. As people choose to keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly and will develop the faith to obey Christ. Thus, you should help the people you work with grow in faith by inviting them to repent and to make and keep commitments. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 107) - Read one or two of the following passages, and ponder what an investigator must feel to be converted. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and members: 2 Nephi 4:16–35; Enos 1; Mosiah 4–5; 18:7–14; 27–28; Alma 5; 17–22; 32; 36; 38 - Read one or two of the following passages and ponder what you as a missionary and as a member must feel to teach with converting power.

You will succeed in your work as you learn to receive and follow personal revelation. Joseph Smith also taught that revelation is vital for your daily work: “This is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed” (History of the Church, 5:135). God loves you and all His children. He is anxious to support you in your practical and specific challenges. You have been promised inspiration to know what to do and have been given the power to do it (see D&C 43:15–16). He will help you as you try to recognize and understand the Spirit through diligent scripture study. He will guide you to people who will receive the message of the Restoration. He will give you power to deliver the message and to testify of Christ and His gospel. He will shower His blessings upon you through the gift of the Holy Ghost. He asks that you remain worthy of this gift and that you ask, seek, and knock (see D&C 4:7; Matthew 7:7–8). We live in the day prophesied by Book of Mormon prophets—a day when people will “contend one with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance” (2 Nephi 28:4; see also 3 Nephi 29:6; Mormon 9:7–8). Yet many people also yearn for spiritual things. As you learn to receive personal revelation, you will teach with power and authority (see Alma 17:3) because the Holy Ghost gives you power to speak (see 1 Nephi 10:22). You need to seek and receive personal revelation through the Holy Ghost as you help people become baptized and confirmed. Have faith that you will receive personal revelation to guide you from day to day. The Holy Ghost will help you in every aspect of your work. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 104) In Moroni’s concluding testimony, he wrote “a few words by way of exhortation” (Moroni 10:2). Read Moroni 10 and write in your own words what Moroni exhorts the reader of the Book of Mormon to do. (Exhort means to encourage strongly or urge someone to do something.) ## The Light of Christ (Page 104) A person is capable of receiving spiritual guidance before being baptized and confirmed. This spiritual influence begins with the Light of Christ, which “is given to every man, that he may know good from evil” (Moroni 7:16; see also verses 14–19). “The light of Christ is just what the words imply: enlightenment, knowledge, and an uplifting, ennobling, persevering influence that comes upon mankind because of Jesus Christ. . . . “The light of Christ should not be confused with the personage of the Holy Ghost, for the light of Christ is not a personage at all. Its influence is preliminary to and preparatory to one’s receiving the Holy Ghost. The light of Christ will lead the honest soul who ‘hearkeneth to the voice’ to find the true gospel and the true Church and thereby receive the Holy Ghost” (Bible Dictionary, “Light of Christ,” 725; see also D&C 84:46–47). President Boyd K. Packer said, “It is important for a . . . missionary . . . to know that the Holy Ghost can work through the Light of Christ. A teacher of gospel truths is not planting something foreign or even new into an adult or a child. Rather, the missionary or teacher is making contact with the Spirit of Christ already there. The gospel will have a familiar ‘ring’ to them” (“The Light of Christ,” address delivered at the seminar for new mission presidents, 22 June 2004, 2). ## The Holy Ghost (Page 104) - **The personage of the Holy Ghost.** The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. He is a personage of spirit and does not have a body of flesh and bones (see D&C 130:22). He is the Comforter, who the Savior promised would teach His followers all things and bring to their remembrance all things that He had taught them (see John 14:26). - **The power of the Holy Ghost.** The witness that comes to sincere investigators before baptism comes through the power of the Holy Ghost. “The power [of the Holy Ghost] can come upon one before baptism, and is the convincing witness that the gospel is true. It gives one a testimony of Jesus Christ and of his work and the work of his servants upon the earth” (Bible Dictionary, “Holy Ghost,” 704). The Holy Ghost testifies of truth. All people can know the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon through the power of the Holy Ghost. “By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things” (Moroni 10:5). - **The gift of the Holy Ghost.** Investigators who receive a witness do not yet have the promise of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Smith said: “There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him” (History of the Church, 4:555). “The gift [of the Holy Ghost] can come only after proper and authorized baptism, and is conferred by the laying on of hands. . . . The gift of the Holy Ghost is the right to have, whenever one is worthy, the companionship of the Holy Ghost” (Bible Dictionary, “Holy']","Moroni 10:2 encourages individuals to ponder the words of the prophet Moroni and seek the Spirit’s guidance, emphasizing the importance of personal revelation and spiritual preparation. Moroni 10:8–18 details the gifts of the Spirit, such as the gift of tongues and the power to testify of the truth, which are essential for effective missionary work. Together, these scriptures highlight that sincere seeking through faith and prayer invites the Holy Ghost and spiritual gifts, enabling missionaries to teach with power and authority. Understanding and applying these principles can help missionaries create a Spirit-filled teaching environment, strengthen their testimony, and effectively guide others toward conversion by relying on the Spirit’s influence as taught in both passages.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” (A Witness and a Warning [1988], 18–19). The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach investigators. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach investigators. | Missionary Lesson | Doctrines | References | | --- | --- | --- | | The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ | Apostasy, Restoration, Joseph Smith, priesthood authority | 1 Nephi 12-14 2 Nephi 3; 26-29 Mosiah 18 | | The Plan of Salvation | The “great plan of the eternal God,” including the Fall of Adam, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the Judgment | 2 Nephi 2; 9 Mosiah 3; 15 Alma 12; 40-42 | | The Gospel of Jesus Christ | Faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end | 2 Nephi 31-32 3 Nephi 11; 27 | | The Commandments; Laws and Ordinances | Ordinances such as baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament | 3 Nephi 11:22-28; 18 Moroni 2-6 | #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 119) Write answers to the following questions in your study journal: - How has your study of the Book of Mormon influenced your testimony of Jesus Christ? - How can you use the Book of Mormon to help strengthen others’ testimonies? #### Scripture study (Page 119) - What does the Savior say about the Book of Mormon? (Page 119) - D&C 1:29, D&C 42:12, D&C 17:6 ## The Book of Mormon Testifies of Christ (Page 119) A central purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ (see title page of the Book of Mormon). It testifies of Christ by affirming the reality of His life, mission, and power. It teaches true doctrine concerning the Atonement—the foundation for the plan of salvation. Several of those whose writings are preserved in the Book of Mormon saw Christ personally. The brother of Jared, Nephi, and Jacob saw the premortal Christ. Mormon and Moroni saw the risen Christ. In addition, multitudes were present during the Savior’s brief but powerful ministry among the Nephites (see 3 Nephi 11–28). Those who know little or nothing about the Savior will come to know Him by reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon. The testimony of the Book of Mormon confirms the testimony of the Bible that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior of the world. As you teach the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you will testify often about the Savior and Redeemer of the world. By the power of the Holy Ghost, you will add your living witness of the truthfulness of this message. #### Scripture Study (Page 119) - What reasons did the Book of Mormon prophets give for writing their records? | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 Nephi 6:4-6 | 2 Nephi 33:13-15 | Words of Mormon 1:3-8 | | 1 Nephi 9:3-5 | Jacob 1:4-7 | Alma 37:2, 14 | | 2 Nephi 4:15-16 | Jacob 4:1-6, 12 | 3 Nephi 5:14-15 | | 2 Nephi 25:23-29 | Enos 1:13 | Mormon 8:35 | | 2 Nephi 26:15-16 | Jarom 1:2 | D&C 3:16-20 | | 2 Nephi 29:11-14 | Omni 1:25-26 | D&C 10:46-48 | ## The Book of Mormon and the Bible Support Each Other (Page 120) People’s beliefs about the Bible vary widely. Some believe that the Bible is absolutely perfect, without error, and that it is all we need to be saved. Others think the Bible is literature worth studying, but they deny that it is evidence of Christ’s divinity and miracles or direct revelation from God. Some choose to ignore the Bible, and others have never seen the Bible or had a chance to read it. Latter-day Saints “believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly” (Articles of Faith 1:8). Far from competing with the Bible, the Book of Mormon supports it, exhorts us to read it, and testifies of the truthfulness of its message. You should use the Book of Mormon and the Bible to support one another. The Book of Mormon speaks of the ancient covenants God made with His children; the Bible tells of great prophets who also received these covenants by faith. The Book of Mormon testifies of Christ and His Atonement; the Bible provides the account of His birth, ministry, death, Atonement, and Resurrection. Thus, the Bible and Book of Mormon complement and enrich each other. The LDS edition of the King James Version of the Bible and the Book of Mormon have cross-references and study aids that make the stick of Judah (the Bible) and the stick of Joseph (the Book of Mormon) one in our hands (see Ezekiel 37:15–17; see also 1 Nephi 13:34–41; 2 Nephi 3:12; 29:8). Give priority to Book of Mormon passages when you teach, but also show how the Book of Mormon and the Bible teach the same principles. Use the Book of Mormon to clarify and explain Bible passages. For example, the New Testament states that Christ was baptized to “fulfil all righteousness” (Matthew 3:14–15). The Book of Mormon explains what it means to fulfill all righteousness (see 2 Nephi', ""<2-hop>\n\nchapter. - Over the course of several weeks, review the Savior’s teachings in the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and 3 Nephi. In your study journal, make a list of the questions He asked. Compare these questions with the questions you typically ask. Read the account of Ammon and King Lamoni in Aima 18 and the account of Aaron in Alma 22:4-18. As you read, identify and describe how Ammon and Aaron: - Followed the Spirit and taught with love. - Began to teach - Adapted their teachings to meet needs. - Bore testimony. - Used the scriptures. - Asked questions, listened, and resolved concerns. - Encouraged those they taught to make commitments. - Ponder the following statements by President Harold B. Lee regarding teaching for understanding. Evaluate how clearly you teach the doctrines of the gospel. Record what you learn in your study journal. “May you stay with the context of the scripture and reduce it to understandable terms” (The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, sel. Clyde J. Williams [1996], 444). “Now you as teachers are not being sent out to teach new doctrine. You're to teach the old doctrines, not so plain that they can just understand, but you must teach the doctrines of the Church so plainly that no one can misunderstand” (The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, 458). ### Companion Study (Page 208) - Review your lesson plan from a recent lesson you have taught. Write one question for each of the major principles outlined in your plan. Then review your questions to see whether they are in harmony with what is taught in this chapter. Next, answer each question as though you were an investigator. Revise your questions as needed. Share your questions with your companion. Together, evaluate your questions. Consider the needs of an investigator you are teaching. Discuss how he or she might answer your questions. Also discuss how these questions may invite the Spirit and help the investigator learn the gospel. - Think of each of your new investigators. Discuss what you can do to help them become a progressing investigator. Write your ideas in your study journal and make plans in your daily planner. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 208) - Invite members or current investigators to your meeting. Explain to the group that you want missionaries to improve their ability to share their important message. Select a lesson and a skill. Have the missionaries teach the members or investigators the lesson you have selected for 20 minutes, focusing on the skill you have identified. Have them switch after 20 minutes. After the missionaries have had an opportunity to teach, bring the group together and have the members and investi- gators tell the missionaries what was most effective and one way they can improve. - Show video examples of missionaries teaching or contacting people. Select a skill and discuss as a group how well the missionaries in the video applied the principles for that skill. - Select a skill or an important aspect of a skill, and identify doctrine or scripture passages that support the skill. Teach the doctrinal foundation of the skill to the missionaries. ### Mission President (Page 208) - Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach. Plan with them how you can participate in the teaching. - Encourage priesthood leaders to accompany missionaries in their teaching visits and provide feedback. - Demonstrate the effective use of scriptures, questions, and listening when teaching missionaries in zone conferences and interviews. > Beginning of chapter 11 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Help People Make and Keep Commitments? (Page 209) #### Consider This (Page 209) - Why should I focus on inviting people to make commitments? - How do commitments relate to conversion? - How can I bear humble testimony? - What blessings can I promise? - Why is it important for me to follow up when people make commitments? ## Extend Commitment Invitations (Page 209) As a missionary you desire the salvation of souls (see Mosiah 28:3). You know that people can come unto Christ and be saved only on conditions of repentance (see D&C 18:10–16). One way to fulfill your desires is to cry repentance (see Alma 5:49; D&C 15:6; 16:6) and boldly invite people to exercise faith unto repentance, to be baptized by water and the Spirit, and to endure faithfully to the end (see 3 Nephi 27:16–20; Mormon 7:10). Commitment is an essential part of repentance. It is the act of obligating oneself to a course of action and then diligently following through on that decision. When people are genuinely committed, they have real intent, meaning that they fully intend to do what they have committed to do. They make an unwavering and earnest decision to change. They become devoted to Christ and dedicate themselves to His gospel. Keeping their commitment is how they “truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins” (D&C 20:37). When you ask for commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting the investigator to repent. One of the best ways to help people make and keep commitments is to extend a commitment invitation. Extending and following up on commitment invitations is vital because: - People become converted as they live the principles they learn (see John 7:17) and feel the Spirit confirm that what they are doing is pleasing to their Father in Heaven. - Repentance and change will help people conquer challenges, rid themselves of shame and guilt, and experience the peace and joy of God’s forgiveness. - Keeping commitments prepares people to make and keep sacred covenants. You can show your love for the people and your faith in God’s promises by following up to help them repent and keep their commitments. The commitments required for baptism are listed in the first four lessons. The commitments related to spiritual progress after baptism and confirmation are listed in lesson 5.""]","The context explains that if the Book of Mormon is true and witnesses the Spirit, then the claims of the Restoration, including priesthood keys and revelation, are also true. The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is a powerful resource in conversion because it teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly and supports the claims of the Restoration. It affirms Jesus as the Christ and testifies of His Atonement, helping people come to know Him. Therefore, Mormon teachings emphasize that the Book of Mormon is central in testifying of Christ and supporting the priesthood authority, which are essential for conversion and strengthening faith.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

We have in very deed the pearl of great price. We have that which is of more value than all the wealth and the scientific information which the world possesses. We have the plan of life and salvation. . . . The best way in the world to show our love for our neighbor is to go forth and proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, of which he has given us an absolute knowledge concerning its divinity” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1927, 175–76). ### President George Albert Smith (1945–1951) (Page 26) “That is your mission, my brethren and sisters of the Church, that is your responsibility. Freely you have received and our Heavenly Father will expect you freely to share with His other sons and daughters these glorious truths” (Sharing the Gospel with Others, sel. Preston Nibley [1948], 213). “We will attain our exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom only on the condition that we share with our Father’s other children the blessings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and observe the commandments that will enrich our lives here and hereafter” (Sharing the Gospel with Others, 190). ### President David O. McKay (1951–1970) (Page 27) “Every member . . . a missionary!” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1959, 122). “True Christianity is love in action. There is no better way to manifest love for God than to show an unselfish love for your fellow men. This is the spirit of missionary work” (Gospel Ideals [1954], 129). ### President Joseph Fielding Smith (1970–1972) (Page 27) “We have heard that we are all missionaries. Every member . . . is or ought to be a missionary; . . . as members of the Church, having pledged ourselves to the advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ we become missionaries. That is part of the responsibility of every member of the Church” (Take Heed to Yourselves [1971], 27–28). ### President Harold B. Lee (1972–1973) (Page 27) “Missionary work is but home teaching to those who are not now members of the Church, and home teaching is nothing more or less than missionary work to Church members” (Improvement Era, Dec. 1964, 1078). ### President Spencer W.

She might be someone you met only yesterday. But we have what they need. Let us take new courage from our studies and pray, as did Peter, ‘And now, Lord, . . . grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word’ (Acts 4:29)” (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball [1982], 546). ### President Ezra Taft Benson (1985–1994) (Page 27) “We must share the gospel with others. That is our responsibility—every member a missionary.

Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ## The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power? Study Alma 17:2–3, D&C 53:3, 1 Corinthians 2:4 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 19) Look at the painting of Christ ordaining the Apostles, and then read John 15:1–16. - In what way is Christ the vine? How are you a branch of that vine? How does your setting apart relate to this relationship? - Read again your ministerial certificate. Record your feelings and thoughts about what you read. Each time you study this chapter, repeat this process.

What blessings did Joseph Smith request for the faithful? ## The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 19) The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work. The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will,']","The context highlights that Spencer W. Kimball emphasized the importance of carrying the gospel farther than ever before, encouraging members and elders to speak boldly and share the message of salvation. It states that he called for renewed courage and prayerful efforts to help others, recognizing that many are crying out for help and need the gospel. His teachings about the mission of elders and members align with his own role as a leader who set an example by urging others to fulfill their responsibilities in missionary work, emphasizing that every member is a missionary and that the power of the Holy Ghost is essential in teaching and testifying of the truth, which reflects his own commitment to spreading the gospel and inspiring others to do the same.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does Christ's Atonement and Resurrection enable us to return to God's presence and achieve eternal life through faith and repentance?,"['<1-hop>\n\nNephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away', '<2-hop>\n\nrighteousness and our guilt. If we have repented, we will receive mercy. We will be rewarded according to our works and our desires. Through the resurrection all people will become immortal—they will live forever. Immortality is a free gift to all people, whether they are righteous or wicked. Eternal life is not, however, the same as immortality. Eternal life is a gift of God given only to those who obey His gospel. It is the highest state that we can achieve. It comes to those who are freed from sin and suffering through the Atonement of Christ. It is exaltation, which means living with God forever in eternal families. It is to know God and Jesus Christ and to experience the life they enjoy. ### Resurrection and Reincarnation (Page 67) Some people may confuse the doctrine of resurrection with the concept of reincarnation. The concept of reincarnation involves being born into the world again in a different form and is false doctrine. The doctrine of resurrection involves receiving an eternal reward of an immortal body of flesh and bone. This is true doctrine. Make sure those you teach understand clearly the doctrine of the resurrection. > Lesson Two: Eighth Principle ## Kingdoms of Glory (Page 67) During our mortal lives we make choices regarding good and evil. God rewards us according to our works and desires. Because God rewards everyone according to deeds done in the body, there are different kingdoms of glory to which we may be assigned after the Judgment. Those who have repented of their sins and received the ordinances of the gospel and kept the associated covenants will be cleansed by the Atonement of Christ. They will receive exaltation in the highest kingdom, also known as the celestial kingdom. They will live in God’s presence, become like Him, and receive a fulness of joy. They will live together for eternity with those of their family who qualify. In the scriptures this kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun. People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars. #### Scripture Study (Page 68) - Resurrection and Restoration: 2 Nephi 9:14–15, Jacob 6:8–9,Alma 42:13–15, 22–23 - Judgment: 2 Nephi 28:23, Mosiah 3:23–25, Alma 5:15–21, Alma 12:12–14, D&C 132:12; 137:9 John 5:22 - Kingdoms of Glory: 3 Nephi 28:10, D&C 76: Introduction, D&C 76, D&C 137, Matthew 5:48, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40 - Eternal Life: 2 Nephi 31:17–21, D&C 14:7, D&C 29:43–44, D&C 45:8, D&C 93:19, John 3:16, John 17:3 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 68) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach.']","Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and desires. His sacrifice satisfies the demands of justice, allowing mercy to be applied when we repent and obey His commandments. Faith in Christ leads us to accept His Atonement, repent of our sins, and strive to keep His commandments. Through sincere repentance and faith in Christ, we become worthy to return to God's presence and can receive the highest blessing—eternal life—living with Him forever in exaltation. This process is central to our spiritual development and ultimate salvation, as it allows us to overcome sin and be cleansed by the Atonement, leading to eternal life in God's presence.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

Through His atoning sacrifice, we can be forgiven of our sins and return to live in the presence of Heavenly Father. Developing Christlike attributes and enduring to the end are essential parts of following the Savior's example, as we apply principles like faith, repentance, and obedience. Baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost are vital ordinances that help us stay connected to the Savior, receive His guidance, and strengthen our faith.

How does 1 Nephi 8:12 relate to the importance of the gospel and the restoration of true doctrines as discussed in the context?,"['<1-hop>\n\ngospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ## Addressing the Importance of the Family (Page 173) The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity. Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following: *There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity. Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.* You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration: *The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrines and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about . . .* The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world. ## The Importance of Members (Page 174) Work with members of the Church to find people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to investigate the restored gospel. This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and less-active members, recent converts, and part-member families. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting. Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better way. That way is through the members of the Church. Whenever there is a member who introduces an investigator, there is an immediate support system. The member bears testimony of the truth of the work. He is anxious for the happiness of his investigator friend. He becomes excited as that friend makes progress in learning the gospel. “The full-time missionaries may do the actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up', '<2-hop>\n\nfor Baptism: 2 Nephi 9:23, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 7:14–15, 3 Nephi 11:23–27, Moroni 6:1–4, D&C 20:37, Acts 2:37–39 - The Lord Institutes the Sacrament: 3 Nephi 18:1–18, Luke 22:15–20 - Promised Blessings of Baptism: Mosiah 4:11–12, 26, Moroni 8:25–26, John 3:5, Romans 6:4 - The Sacrament Prayers: Moroni 4 and 5, D&C 20:75–79 - Partaking of the Sacrament: D&C 27:2, 1 Corinthians 11:23–29 - Necessity for Authority: D&C 22, Hebrews 5:4 > Lesson Three: Fifth Principle ## The Gift of the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson.

Specifically, 1 Nephi 8:12 highlights the significance of the tree of life and the desire to partake of its fruit, symbolizing the blessings of the gospel. The context explains that when people disregard or distort true doctrines, God withdraws His authority, but He has again reached out through the prophet Joseph Smith, restoring essential truths through the Book of Mormon. The verse underscores the importance of treasuring and sharing these restored doctrines, which lead to eternal life and strengthen families, as part of the broader message about the gospel's role in our spiritual journey.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

If circumstances allow, help them prepare to be baptized in the temple for their deceased ancestors. • Invite converts to prepare family members and friends to be taught by the missionaries. The missionaries should ask new converts and less-active members for referrals. ### Nourishment by the Word of God (Page 230) - Finish teaching the principles in lesson 5, “Laws and Ordinances.” - Remind new converts and less-active members of commitments they made before baptism and the covenants they made when they were baptized and confirmed. - Encourage them to pray daily as individuals and with their families. - Encourage them to study the scriptures daily, especially the Book of Mormon. - Strengthen new converts’ testimonies of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Review the lessons that you taught before baptism and confirmation, adapting the commitment invitations to their current needs. - Continue to teach the importance of attending church each Sunday and worthily partaking of the sacrament. Attend and sit with new converts or less-active members. - Invite them to attend the Gospel Principles class during Sunday School. - Teach them how to hold family home evening on Monday nights using the Family Home Evening Resource Book. - Encourage them to share the restored gospel with others. - Help them enroll in seminary or institute classes. - Make them aware of Church resources such as www.mormon.org, www.lds.org, and www.familysearch.org. #### Scripture Study (Page 231) - Nourish with God’s - Mosiah 18:18-20, Alma 31:5, Moroni 6:4 - Service - Mosiah 2:17, Matthew 25:40, Topical Guide, “Serve” and “Service” ## What Is the Role of the Full-Time Mission President? (Page 231) The full-time mission president holds the keys for convert baptisms. Under his direction, full-time missionaries have primary responsibility for teaching investigators. However, the bishop oversees the progress and friendshipping of investigators as they are being taught. The ward mission plan is carried out under the presiding authority of the bishop. The mission president meets regularly with stake presidents to make sure that full-time missionaries cooperate with local priesthood leaders. He coordinates proselyting efforts and offers to help the stake president provide instruction in the principles and practices of missionary work. ## What Are the Responsibilities of Stake and Ward Leaders? (Page 231) Local Church leaders and members are your best allies. Respect them and strive to build good relationships with them. As you work with these leaders, remember that they have other responsibilities associated with their callings. Seek to be a blessing, not a burden, to the leaders of your stake and ward. Your attitude should be one of, “How can we help?” Counsel with the bishop and ward mission leader concerning your plans and activities. Make sure that what you do supports the ward mission plan. The roles of local priesthood leadership in missionary work are described below. Understanding their roles will help you better work with them. ### Stake President (Page 231) The stake president oversees bishops in their missionary, retention, and activation responsibilities. In his monthly interview with bishops, he discusses plans and the progress of specific investigators and members. He ensures that the doctrines relating to missionary work are taught regularly in stake and ward meetings and that priesthood leaders and others are trained in their missionary responsibilities. The stake president also meets regularly with the mission president to coordinate missionary efforts, including the training of leaders and members, use and placement of full-time missionaries, and assistance in activation efforts. ### High Councilor (Page 232) A high councilor is assigned by the stake presidency to promote missionary, retention, and activation work in the stake. He regularly reports the progress of this work to the stake presidency. He also ensures that ward mission leaders are properly trained in their duties, including the preparation of a ward mission plan. ### Bishop (Page 232) The bishop is responsible for missionary, retention, and activation efforts in the ward. His personal participation and leadership are essential. To help accomplish this work, the bishop calls a worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holder to serve as the ward mission leader. He also calls a sufficient number of ward missionaries to meet the needs in the ward. The bishop uses the priesthood executive committee and the ward council to coordinate missionary, retention, and activation efforts. He gives direction to developing and carrying out a ward mission plan. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 232) Plan a time to meet with the bishop. Seek his guidance on how you can best serve in the ward. ### Priesthood and Auxiliary Leaders (Page 232) Priesthood and auxiliary leaders should regularly review the status of new members and less-active members and plan how to best fellowship and strengthen them. They should also work closely with the ward mission leader to coordinate missionary, retention, and activation efforts with ward missionaries and full-time missionaries. ### Ward Mission Leader (Page 232) Ward Mission Leader Under the direction of the bishop, the ward mission leader: - Sets an example in sharing the gospel with others and fellowshipping investigators, new converts, and less-active members. - Coordinates the work of the ward missionaries and full-time missionaries with priesthood leaders, auxiliary leaders, and members. - Uses the Progress Record, the Convert Action List, and the Bishopric Action and Interview List to review the progress of investigators, new converts, and less-active members in priesthood executive committee and ward council meetings. The Convert Action List and the Bishopric Action and Interview List are reports created using the ward meetinghouse computer. They are used to track the progress of new converts and other members. - Conducts weekly missionary coordination meetings. - Organizes convert baptismal services in the ward in cooperation with the full-time missionaries.

Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and']","The context highlights that baptism is a fundamental step in becoming a disciple of Christ, as emphasized through various scriptural references such as Matthew 28:19, which underscores the command to baptize. It also explains that baptism must be followed by the gift of the Holy Ghost to be complete, enabling spiritual rebirth and the remission of sins. The teachings stress that only through proper priesthood authority, as restored through Joseph Smith, can one receive the Holy Ghost, which testifies of Christ, provides spiritual strength, and guides believers. In missionary work, this process is central, with missionaries inviting individuals to follow Christ’s example by being baptized and receiving the Holy Ghost, thus beginning a new spiritual life and enduring to the end through faith, repentance, and obedience, as outlined in the scriptures and teachings about the importance of these ordinances in the journey of discipleship.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Many of these people, however, will have beliefs, practices, and places which they hold sacred. As a servant of God, it is essential that you show proper respect for their religious beliefs and traditions. Do not do anything that would show disrespect for that which is important to them. You may wonder how you should adjust your teaching approach to these people. It will be helpful to remember that in order to be converted, all of God’s children, regardless of background, must develop faith in Jesus Christ, repent, receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, and endure to the end by keeping the commandments and giving service. The principles that help others build faith in Jesus Christ are the same in all cultures. You can help people gain a correct understanding of God as our Heavenly Father and develop faith in Jesus Christ by helping them have personal spiritual experiences rather than simply telling them about the nature of God. For example, you will help people gain this understanding as they: - Gain a spiritual conviction that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. - Hear your sincere teaching and testimony of the gospel, including why you chose to follow Jesus Christ. - Frequently hear you and other members talk to Heavenly Father in a simple, heartfelt prayer. - Hear you bear powerful testimony. - Pray with you and on their own. - Come to learn how you feel about the scriptures as you read and discuss them. - Read God’s word from the scriptures daily (especially the Book of Mormon). - Attend church so they can see how we worship the Lord. - Meet members of the Church who can explain how they came to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. - Keep the commandments. These activities are beneficial for all people you teach, but they are essential when teaching those without a Christian background because these people are less likely to have had these experiences previously. Many converts from non-Christian backgrounds report that they did not understand much of what the missionaries were saying but that they felt the Spirit and wanted to do what the missionaries asked. You must do all you can to help investigators understand the doctrines of the gospel. Be patient and supportive, as it may take some time for people to learn to identify and express the feelings they have inside. You may need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching to help them understand. As you prepare to teach those without a Christian background, the following suggestions may help: - Provide simple overviews and reviews for each lesson. - Ask them to tell you what they understand and what they have experienced. - Take the time to define essential words and principles. Those you teach may not be familiar with many of the words you will use as you teach. - Return to a previously taught lesson to teach the doctrine more clearly. This may be necessary any time in the teaching process. #### Scriptural Examples (Page 206) The scriptures contain examples of missionaries who have taught those who did not believe in God or who misunderstood His true nature. Study the scriptures below, and then explain to your companion or record in your study journal how these missionaries helped people gain a testimony that God exists. - Alma and Amulek (Alma 9–12; 15) - Ammon and Aaron (Alma 17–22) - Alma (Alma 30) - Alma and others (Alma 31–35) - Paul (Acts 17:16–34) #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 206) When possible, identify a convert who was not part of a Christian tradition before meeting with the missionaries. Arrange to meet with him or her, and ask about his or her conversion experience. For example, you might ask what led the person to believe in God, the first time he or she prayed, the first time he or she felt an answer to prayer, the role of the scriptures in his or her conversion, and what it was like to attend Sunday services. Write what you learn in your study journal. #### Remember This (Page 206) - As people are taught the restored gospel and live it, their needs will be met. - Plan and study each day with your companion to be united and to teach with one voice. - Share your testimony frequently. - The scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, are your basic sources for teaching. - Pray for the gift of discernment to know when to use the skills described in this chapter. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 207) ### Personal Study (Page 206) - Assume you are placed in the following situations. How might you use the principles and skills in this chapter to help these people progress? Plan how you would apply them in each situation. - While walking through a park, you see a woman and a small boy sitting alone on a bench. The woman is crying. - You arrive at the home of investigators who have been preparing for baptism, and they tell you that they no longer want to meet with you. - You are meeting for the seventh time with an investigator who has been taught by several missionaries over a two-year period. There have been few if any signs of progress. - You are beginning to teach a member family a gospel message, and they say, “We have already asked everyone we know to meet with the missionaries, and they have all said no.” - Select one of the missionary lessons. Identify one or two scripture passages from each main principle. Practice teaching from those passages as outlined in the “Use the Scriptures” section of this', '<2-hop>\n\nthis principle help people gain faith and testimony? - How will this commitment help people repent and be more sensitive to the Spirit? ## Bear Testimony Frequently (Page 212) A testimony is a spiritual witness and assur- ance given by the Holy Ghost. To bear testimony is to give a simple, direct declaration of belief—a feeling, an assurance, a conviction of gospel truth. Sharing your testimony often is one of the most powerful ways of inviting the Spirit and helping others feel the Spirit. It adds a current, personal witness to the truths you have taught from the scriptures. An effective missionary teaches, testifies, and invites others to do things that build faith in Jesus Christ. This includes making promises that come from living true principles. For example, a missionary might say, “I know as you keep the Sabbath day holy, you will find more peace in your heart.” For your testimony to have convincing power, you must be sincere. Powerful testimony is not dependent on eloquence or the volume of your voice but on the conviction of your heart. Strive daily to strengthen your understanding and conviction of the doctrines and principles you are to teach. Bear testimony often to seal the truth of the principles or doctrine you are teaching. As often as possible, teach, then testify, and testify as you teach. Your testimony may be as simple as “Jesus Christ is the Son of God” or “I have learned for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.” You may also share a brief experience about how you gained this knowledge. Bear testimony several times in each lesson, not just at the end. Bear testimony that what your companion has taught is from God. Bear testimony that the principle you are going to teach will bless the investigators’ lives if they will follow it. Talk about how living a principle has blessed your life. People may sometimes intellectually question what you teach, but it is difficult to question a sincere, heartfelt testimony. When you testify, pray that those you are teaching will feel the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. When you testify, you help create an environment for investigators to feel the Holy Ghost confirming your witness of the truth. This prepares them to accept the commitments you will extend. Brigham Young was not baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the first year of his learning about the restored gospel. But of his conversion he said: “If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared, in the most exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it by learning and worldly wisdom, they would have been to me like smoke which arises only to vanish away. But when I saw a man without eloquence or talents for public speaking, who could only say, ‘I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord,’ the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my understanding, and a light, glory, and immortality were before me. I was encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself that the testimony of the man was true” (in Journal of Discourses, 1:90). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 213) The passages below are examples of bearing testimony. Read each of the questions and scriptures. Write your answers in your study journal. - In these verses, of what do the apostles and prophets testify? - How strongly do they believe what they are saying? How can you tell that they are convinced of the truth? - When you say, “I know that ________ is true,” what do you mean? What other words can you use to convey your convictions? - Jacob 7:7–12, Alma 5:45–48, Alma 34:1, 8; Acts 2:14–38, Acts 10:34–44, D&C 76:22–24, John 3:3–11 #### Scripture Study (Page 214) - What are some principles and promises of bearing testimony? - 2 Nephi 33:1, D&C 62:3, D&C 84:61, D&C 100:5–8, John 15:26 ## Follow Up (Page 214) Extending an invitation without following up is like beginning a journey without finishing it or buying a ticket to a concert without going into the theater. Without the completed action, the commitment is hollow. Change can be hard. Your role is to help strengthen people in their resolve to change. You should do all you can to help people keep their commitments. Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time especially for commandments such as chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and tithing. As you and ward leaders work with people to help them keep their commitments, show understanding. Be patient but persistent. You have not finished your ministry until people are living these commitments, or in other words, until they have repented (see 3 Nephi 18:32). Sometimes several visits may be necessary for you to help people develop strong enough faith in a principle to lead to repentance. Following up begins when you first visit and teach people: - Have them write their commitment on something you leave with them, such as a pamphlet or a card with your names and phone number. - Make sure people know that you will make brief, daily visits between teaching appointments. Explain that your purpose is to support and help them. Give them an idea of what you will do during those visits. - Make specific notes in the Notes/To Do List section of your planner to follow up tomorrow on every commitment invitation you have extended today. Make frequent contact, daily if possible, to find out how people are progressing with their commitments, answer questions, help them overcome challenges, teach additional lessons, read together from the Book of Mormon, share passages of scripture, or use audiovisual materials. As you visit people often, you will strengthen the spiritual feelings they felt as you taught them']","The Acts provide scriptural examples of missionaries who helped people gain a testimony by teaching them about God and His Son, Jesus Christ, through personal experiences, scriptures, and sincere testimony. For instance, Paul in Acts 17:16–34 shared the gospel with those who did not believe in God, helping them develop faith. This process of gaining faith and testimony encourages individuals to repent and become more sensitive to the Spirit because it builds their conviction of gospel truths, prompts them to keep commandments, and invites the Spirit to work more fully in their lives, leading to genuine conversion and spiritual growth.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the Savior's role in the atonement relate to developing Christlike attributes during missionary service, as described in the standards of behavior and conduct?","['<1-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with', '<2-hop>\n\nand His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. #### Scripture Study (Page 20) What is the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ? - Read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27:13–22 for answers to the question.']","The context emphasizes that developing Christlike attributes such as kindness, humility, and love is essential for missionary conduct and is made possible through the Savior's help. The Savior's role in the atonement provides the foundation for becoming more like Him, enabling missionaries to develop these qualities with His assistance. By striving to embody Christlike behavior, missionaries follow the Savior's example and deepen their spiritual growth, which aligns with the themes of being Christlike and the Savior's central role in their service.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How do D&C 8:2-3 and D&C 42:8 relate to praying about the Book of Mormon and finding people to teach, especially when you consider the importance of spiritual guidance and involving members in your efforts?","['<1-hop>\n\nand pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet.

(Page 169) #### Consider This (Page 169) - What does it mean to “find them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8)? - How do I increase my faith to find people to teach? - Why should I involve members in my finding efforts? - What is the role of media and Church headquarters referrals? - What is the relationship between finding and teaching? - What is the role of service in finding people to teach? - What are some ideas for finding people to teach that I have not yet tried? ## Developing the Faith to Find (Page 169) The doctrines and principles in this chapter will strengthen your faith that the Lord is preparing people to receive you and the restored gospel. He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world. Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal. The Family of God. All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see Acts 17:26–29; Hebrews 12:9). We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious . . . ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (Alma 31:34–35). “Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message. Many of these people have been “kept from the truth [only] because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). Usually you do not know who these people are. They may not immediately recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They may not understand that greater peace, direction, and purpose in life will come through the restored gospel than from anything else. They often do not realize that they are looking for the restored gospel until they have found it. For example, one convert said, “When I heard the gospel, it filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t know was there.” Another said, “I have finished the search I didn’t know I was on.” Wherever you are assigned to serve, remember that the Lord has “suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in [Him] for the salvation of souls.” Work effectively to “lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that [the Lord] shall put in your hearts.” If you do, you will receive the promise that “you shall not be confounded before men,” and “it shall be given you . . . in the very moment, what ye shall say” (D&C 100:4–6). Finding by the Spirit is as important as teaching by the Spirit. As in teaching, your efforts in finding will be effective if you are guided by the Spirit. Have faith that you will know what to teach and what to do to find those who will receive you. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 170) Many of the members you visit may be converts to the Church. Plan a time to ask them how they came in contact with the Church and how they came to recognize that the missionaries were teaching them the truth. Summarize their experiences in your study journal. #### Scripture Study (Page 170) How are God’s children prepared and led to the restored gospel? - Alma 13:24, D&C 29:7, D&C 84:45-47, 88 - Alma 16:16-17, D&C 33:6, D&C 136:32-33 ## Talk with Everyone (Page 170) While the Prophet Joseph Smith was traveling with a group of missionaries on the Missouri River, the Lord revealed, “It is not needful for . . . mine elders to be moving swiftly . . . whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief” (D&C 61:3). As you move swiftly to planned activities, pray for the ability to see unplanned opportunities to serve and teach those who may be “perishing in unbelief.” Pray for the spiritual sensitivity to recognize opportunities. You will find that God will place in your path His children who are being prepared to receive the restored gospel. Nothing happens in missionary work until you find someone to teach. Talk with as many people as you can each day. It is natural to be somewhat apprehensive about talking to people, but you can pray for the faith and strength to be more bold in opening your mouth to proclaim the restored gospel. Try applying the following ideas as you seek to talk with everyone you meet: - Talk to people about their families. Help them see how the restored gospel can be a blessing to their families. - Look for clues—such as items in homes or yards, lettering on clothing, or indications of children—to help you know how to begin talking with people. - Listen sincerely to what people say to you. - Be warm, friendly, and cheerful. Offer to help. - Trust the Spirit to put into your heart and mind what to teach. - Invite everyone to learn about']","D&C 8:2-3 emphasizes that the Holy Ghost can teach us and guide us in understanding spiritual truths, including the message of the Book of Mormon through prayer and pondering. This aligns with the idea that sincere prayer and the Holy Ghost are essential for confirming the truth of the Restoration. D&C 42:8 highlights the importance of finding those who will receive the gospel, which involves seeking divine guidance and being led by the Spirit. When you pray about the Book of Mormon and ask for help to find receptive people, you are applying the principles in these scriptures by inviting the Holy Ghost to direct your efforts. Additionally, involving members in finding and teaching can strengthen your faith and help you recognize opportunities the Spirit provides, fulfilling the Lord’s command to find 'them that will receive you' as described in D&C 42:8.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the emphasis on extending invitations and making commitments in the first context relate to the principles of obedience and covenant-making outlined in the Doctrine and Covenants, and how can understanding these connections enhance a missionary's ability to prepare investigators for baptism as described in the second context?","['<1-hop>\n\nBe constantly aware of the need to invite people to do things that will strengthen their faith in Christ. Remember the following principles: - Every finding opportunity—with members, referrals, or personal contacting—should lead to an invitation to act, usually to learn more about the message of the Restoration. - Rarely, if ever, should you talk to people or teach them without extending an invitation to do something that will strengthen their faith in Christ. - Focus on one or more commitments when you teach. If you do not invite people to make these commitments, you are not asking them to repent and come to Christ. - As you prepare in companion study to teach a lesson, consider the needs and status of each investigator and include one or more commitments in your lesson plan. - During a lesson you may be inspired to extend commitment invitations other than those you planned. Always invite people to repent. - Be bold and confident as you invite people to make commitments (see Alma 38:12). Boldness shows your faith that obedience to the Lord’s commandments brings blessings. - People will not likely change unless they are invited to do so. #### Scripture Study (Page 210) - Why is it so vital to extend invitations? - Alma 5:62, Moroni 7:13 - Why are commitments so important? - 2 Nephi 31, Mosiah 2:41, Alma 7:14–16, Alma 32:27, D&C 14:7, D&C 20:37, John 7:17 ## Ask Direct Questions (Page 211) A commitment invitation often takes the form of a “will you” question, which requires a yes or no response. Invitations should be specific, direct, and clear. They invite or lead people to decide on a course of action. They require them to make a commitment and to exercise active faith in the principles you have taught them. Following are some examples of good invitations, followed by the beginning of a promise and testimony: - Will you read [3 Nephi 11, Moroni 10:3–5, this pamphlet] before our visit tomorrow at 7:00 p.m.? I know that doing so will . . . I testify that the Book of Mormon is . . . - Will you pray and ask God whether Joseph Smith was a prophet? I know that as you pray God will . . . I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet . . . - Will you attend church with us this Sunday at 9:00 a.m.? If you do, you will . . . I know that Christ’s Church has been restored . . . - Will you begin now to live the law of chastity as we have explained it? Living this law will . . . As a servant of the Lord I testify that living a chaste life . . . - Will you invite [name] before Friday to meet with us and begin learning about the gospel? The Spirit will help you . . . Sharing the gospel will bless your life . . . - May we come to your home and tell you more about how God has called a prophet in our day as He did in ancient times? Increased purpose, direction, and peace will come into your life as you come to understand . . . I testify that God has again called . . . ##### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 211) In your study journal, write an invitation that is simple, direct, and clear for each commitment in a lesson. If you have done this activity before, repeat it and compare your new invitations with previous versions. Ask yourself whether your ability to extend invitations has improved. Review the invitations you have written with your companion. For each invitation, discuss the following questions: - Do I explain the Lord’s promised blessings as I extend invitations? If not, why? - Do I avoid extending this invitation? If so, why? - Do I feel awkward when I extend this invitation? How can I improve? - How important is this invitation to me personally? - How often do I remember to follow up on invitations I have extended? How can I improve? Think of investigators or less-active members you know, and practice extending these invitations as though you were addressing these individuals. As necessary, revise the invitations in your lesson plan. Set specific goals that will help you extend invitations throughout the day and week. ## Promise People Blessings (Page 211) People need a reason to change their thoughts and actions. Promised blessings often provide powerful motivation to obey God. When the Lord gives a commandment, He often promises blessings for keeping that commandment (see D&C 130:20–21). As you prepare people to obey a specific commandment, teach them that: - Living the commandments shows love for God and His Son. - They demonstrate their trust in God as they obey His commandments. - In return, they will receive blessings that He has promised. As you testify of a commandment, talk about the blessings you have received from living that commandment. Promise those whom you teach that they can enjoy similar blessings. As people strive to keep a commitment, ask them to talk about the blessings that Heavenly Father has given them. Assure them that even though difficulties will enter their lives, His blessings will continue as they obey His will. #### Scripture Study (Page 212) - What does the Lord say about His desire to bless us? - Alma 37:17, D&C 1:37, D&C 76:5–10 #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 212) Read Doctrine and Covenants 82:10 and 130:20–21. Then study the following scriptures. Make two columns in your study journal. On one side write the commandment you find in each passage. On the other side write the promise for keeping the commandment. - D&C 11:21, D&C 84:85, D&C 89:18–21, D&C 95:8–9, D&C 100:5–8, Malachi 3:10–12 Review the commitments listed in one of the missionary lessons. For each commitment, answer these questions: - What blessings has the Lord promised to those who keep this commitment? - How will obeying', '<2-hop>\n\n- Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Be willing to take upon them the name of Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto a remission of their sins. 2. First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve: - Make sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. - Develop faith in Christ. - Repent of transgressions. - Live the principles of moral worthiness. - Live the Word of Wisdom. - Commit to pay tithing. - Receive all the missionary lessons [lessons 1–4 on the Teaching Record and associated commitments]. - Meet the bishop or branch president. - Attend several sacrament meetings. (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002) When an investigator has set a firm baptismal date, schedule when you will complete all the events that lead to baptism and confirmation as listed in your daily planner. Carefully review the Teaching Record to ensure that you have taught the basic doctrines and that the candidates are prepared to address each question in the baptismal interview. Review this schedule with the person in your next meeting. If possible, the person should attend a baptismal service prior to his or her own baptism. If you feel that the person you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule an interview until the investigator meets the standards. If the candidate is a minor, ensure that the parents or guardians have given permission, preferably in writing, for him or her to be baptized. As you help people prepare for their baptismal interview, talk to them about the purpose of the interview. Teach them and bear testimony about the sacredness of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Explain that you want to make sure they understand the principles you have taught and the covenant they will make. Also explain that the interview is an opportunity for them to witness before the Lord’s representative that they are ready for these sacred ordinances. As they keep the covenant made at baptism and confirmation, they will receive a remission of sins. Share the questions the interviewer will ask about their belief in important doctrines, their repentance of past sins, and their willingness to covenant to obey Jesus Christ throughout their lives. Emphasize that baptism by water is incomplete without confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 219) - Read each of the following passages, and make a summary list of the scriptural qualifications for baptism and confirmation. - 2 Nephi 9:23, 31:4-13; 3 Nephi 27:13-21, D&C 20:37 - Mosiah 18:8-10, Moroni 6:1-4, D&C 22 - Alma 7:14-15, Moroni 8:25-26, Acts 2:37-39 - In baptismal interviews, candidates are asked whether they are willing to take upon themselves the name of Christ. What can you do to help them understand this question? As you ponder this question, study the following scriptures: - Mosiah 4–5, Mosiah 18:1–11, Mosiah 26:18, 21–27; 3 Nephi 27:1–10 You may also want to look for other passages that help you understand this principle. ## How to Conduct the Interview (Page 219) The person conducting the interview should use the baptismal interview questions with the guidance of the Spirit to determine whether the baptismal candidate meets the qualifications described in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. He should also adapt the questions to the age and maturity of the candidate. If a candidate does not qualify according to the baptismal interview questions, the baptism and confirmation should be postponed. The investigator should receive additional teaching by the full-time missionaries and fellowshipping from ward members. The district leader or zone leader who conducts the interview should: - Hold the interview in a comfortable, private place, conducive to feeling the Spirit of the Lord. The interviewer’s companion should be nearby. - Open with prayer. - Help the candidate feel comfortable. - Make the interview a spiritually uplifting experience. - Make sure that the candidate understands the purpose of the interview. - Ask the baptismal interview questions. Use follow-up questions to get a feeling for the strength of the person’s testimony and the sincerity of the person’s repentance. - Answer the candidate’s questions. - Invite the person to bear testimony and express his or her feelings. - If the person has challenges with testimony or worthiness, explain that it would be best to postpone the baptism until he or she is better prepared. #### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 220) 1. Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world? 2. Do you believe the Church and gospel of Jesus Christ have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith? Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God? What does this mean to you? 3. What does it mean to you to repent? Do you feel that you have repented of your past transgressions? 4. Have you ever committed a serious crime? If so, are you now on probation or parole? Have you ever participated in an abortion? a homosexual relationship? 5. You have been taught that membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints includes living gospel standards. What do you understand of the following standards? Are you willing to obey them? - The law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relationship outside the bonds of a legal marriage between a man and a woman. - The law of tithing. - The Word of Wisdom. - The Sabbath day, including partaking of the sacrament weekly and rendering service to fellow members. 6. When you are baptized, you covenant with God that you are willing to take upon yourself the name of Christ and keep His commandments throughout your life. Are you ready']","The first context highlights the importance of inviting individuals to act and make commitments that strengthen their faith in Christ, emphasizing boldness, specific invitations, and the blessings associated with obedience. It underscores that people are unlikely to change unless they are invited to do so and that commitments are vital for spiritual progress. The principles from the Doctrine and Covenants reinforce this by teaching that obedience to commandments demonstrates love for God and leads to promised blessings, such as spiritual growth and remission of sins. Understanding these connections helps missionaries realize that extending clear, heartfelt invitations and encouraging commitments are essential steps in helping investigators accept the gospel and prepare for baptism. By integrating the emphasis on invitations and commitments with the doctrinal understanding of covenant-making—where individuals willingly accept commandments and receive blessings—missionaries can more effectively guide investigators through the process of repentance, obedience, and ultimately, entering into sacred covenants through baptism, as outlined in the second context. This holistic approach ensures that investigators not only understand the doctrinal importance of baptism but also feel motivated and prepared to make and keep sacred promises with the Lord.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How can Ezra Taft Benson's teachings help missionaries use prayer and the Book of Mormon to recognize and testify of the Spirit's influence, especially when facing objections?","['<1-hop>\n\nHow can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ### Mission President (Page 116) - Occasionally ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you. - In interviews, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers. Ask them if they feel their prayers are meaningful. - Ask missionaries how they help investigators feel and recognize the Spirit. - As appropriate, relate to missionaries how you receive revelation on transfers, missionaries who are disobedient or need help, and doctrines to teach. > Beginning of Chapter 5 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon? (Page 117) #### Consider This - How is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion? - How does the Book of Mormon answer the great questions of the soul? - Why is the Book of Mormon so powerful in the conversion process? - How should I use the Book of Mormon to build faith and help others to draw closer to God? - Why is the promise in Moroni 10:3–5 central in missionary work? ## Overview (Page 117) The Book of Mormon is powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching. ## The Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion (Page 117) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (History of the Church, 2:52). An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge- shaped pieces that lean against each other. The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways: - Witness of Christ. “The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.” - Fulness of doctrine. “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (D&C 20:9 [;27:5].) . . . In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation. And they are taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.” - Foundation of testimony. “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon,', '<2-hop>\n\nprayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts . . . the Spirit of the Lord. There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“The Power of the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, June 1988, 6). ## Use the Book of Mormon to Respond to Objections (Page 122) Many people will not believe everything you teach. President Ezra Taft Benson taught how the Book of Mormon can be the central resource in responding to such situations: “We are to use the Book of Mormon in handling objections to the Church. . . . “. . . All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. . . . The only problem the objector has to resolve forhimself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation. “Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively. We are not obligated to answer every objection. Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand” (A Witness and a Warning, 4–5). For example, sincere investigators might object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom. Help them see that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation. You might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.” Investigators must resolve for themselves their concerns and objections. You can help as you focus them on what will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. When they strengthen their testimony of the Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections and concerns. As you answer concerns, remember that our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his successors—who receive direct revelation from God. There- fore, the first question for an investigator to answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. #### Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon (Page 123) One way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 123) In your study journal, write down how you would refer to Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon to respond to the following objections or concerns: - “I don’t believe that God speaks to people anymore.” - “I believe that I can worship God in my own way rather than through some organized religion.” - “Why must I give up drinking wine with my meals if I join your church?” - “Why do I need religion?”']","Ezra Taft Benson emphasized that prayer and the Book of Mormon are central to recognizing the Spirit's influence and strengthening faith. His teachings highlight that prayerful reading of the Book of Mormon brings the Spirit into hearts, fostering obedience and a stronger testimony of Christ. When missionaries face objections, Benson's counsel suggests that the key is to help investigators resolve their concerns by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon, which can confirm Joseph Smith's prophetic role and the truthfulness of the gospel. By combining sincere prayers with the powerful witness of the Book of Mormon, missionaries can help others feel the Spirit, recognize divine influence, and build faith that leads to conversion.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"Peter in 1 Peter how does he talk about like, how to be like, good and stuff, and how does that connect to Joseph Smith seeing the Father and the Son in his vision, like, what does that mean for us today, and how can we use that info to be better missionaries?","['<1-hop>\n\n(Ephesians 4:5). Joseph attended different churches, but he remained confused about which church he should join. He later wrote: *“So great were the confusions and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was . . . to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. . . . In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10).* As Joseph sought truth among the different faiths, he turned to the Bible for guidance. He read, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (James 1:5). Because of this passage, Joseph decided to ask God what he should do. In the spring of 1820 he went to a nearby grove of trees and knelt in prayer. He described his experience: *“I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. . . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17).* In this vision God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith. The Savior told Joseph not to join any of the churches, for they “were all wrong” and “all their creeds were an abomination.” He stated, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof” (Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Even though many good people believed in Christ and tried to understand and teach His gospel, they did not have the fulness of truth or the priesthood authority to baptize and perform other saving ordinances. They had inherited a state of apostasy as each generation was influenced by what the previous one passed on, including changes in the doctrines and in ordinances such as baptism. As God had done with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to the earth. After the appearance of the Father and the Son, other heavenly messengers, or angels were sent to Joseph Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery. John the Baptist appeared and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, which includes the authority to perform the ordinance of baptism. Peter, James, and John (three of Christ’s original Apostles) appeared and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, restoring the same authority given to Christ’s Apostles anciently. With this priesthood authority, Joseph Smith was directed to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth. Through him, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles. The time in which we live is referred to by Bible prophets as the last days, the latter days, or the dispensation of the fulness of times. It is the period of time just before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It is the final dispensation. This is why the Church is named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A living prophet directs the Church today. This prophet, the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is the authorized successor to Joseph Smith. He and the present Apostles trace their authority to Jesus Christ in an unbroken chain of ordinations through Joseph Smith. ### Memorize Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17 (Page 52) Memorize Joseph Smith’s description of seeing the Father and the Son (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17), and always be ready to describe the First Vision using his own words. Do not rush through it. Bear sincere testimony that you know it is true. Do not hesitate to explain how you came to know of its truth. Invite your companion to do so as well. ### Bear Testimony (Page 52) An important part of a missionary’s duty is to bear testimony of the current prophet and president of the Church. #### Scripture Study (page 52) Study 2 Nephi 3, D&C 112:30, Ephesians 1:10, Ephesians 4:5, James 1:5, and Brochure, The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith > Lesson One: Seventh Principle ## The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Page 52) Knowing that doubt, disbelief, and misinformation would remain after centuries of darkness, our loving Heavenly Father brought forth an ancient volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible, which contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. This volume of holy scripture provides convincing evidence that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God. This record is the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where gold plates had lain hidden for centuries. These gold plates contained the writings of prophets giving an account of God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Joseph Smith translated the contents of these plates by the power of God. The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of the Savior and taught His gospel. After His Resurrection, Christ appeared to these people. He taught them His gospel and established His Church. The Book of Mormon proves that “God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old” (D&C 20:11). In order to know that the Book of Mormon is true, a person must read, ponder,', '<2-hop>\n\nabout charity? - 2 Nephi 26:30, Mosiah 2:17, Mosiah 28:3, Alma 7:24, Ether 12:28, D&C 88:125, 1 Timothy 4:12, 1 Peter 4:8; see footnote a ## Virtue (Page 132) Virtue originates in your innermost thoughts and desires. It is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral standards. Since the Holy Ghost does not dwell in unclean tabernacles, virtue is prerequisite to receiving the Spirit’s guidance. What you choose to think and do when you are alone and you believe no one is watching is a strong measure of your virtue. Virtuous people are clean and pure spiritually. They focus on righteous, uplifting thoughts and put unworthy thoughts that lead to inappropriate actions out of their minds. They obey God’s commandments and follow the counsel of Church leaders. They pray for the strength to resist temptation and do what is right. They quickly repent of any sins or wrongdoings. They live worthy of a temple recommend. Your mind is like a stage in a theater; in the theater of your mind, however, only one actor can be on stage at a time. If the stage is left bare, thoughts of darkness and sin often enter the stage to tempt. But these thoughts have no power if the stage of your mind is occupied by wholesome thoughts, such as a memorized hymn or verse of scripture that you can call upon in a moment of temptation. By controlling the stage of your mind, you can successfully resist persistent urges to yield to temptation and indulge in sin. You can become pure and virtuous. #### Scripture Study (Page 133) - What does it mean to be virtuous? - D&C 4:6, D&C 25:2, D&C 38:24 - D&C 46:33, D&C 121:45–46, Articles of Faith 1:13 - 2 Peter 1:3–8, Topical Guide, “Virtue” ## Knowledge (Page 133) The Lord commanded, “Seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&C 88:118). He also warned, “It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance” (D&C 131:6). Seek knowledge, especially spiritual knowledge. Study the scriptures every day, and also study the words of the living prophets. Through study and prayer, seek help for your specific questions, challenges, and opportunities. Give special attention to scripture passages you can use as you teach and as you answer questions about the restored gospel. Think about how you can apply gospel principles in your life. As you study diligently, prayerfully, and with pure intent, the Holy Ghost will enlighten your mind, teach you, and help you understand the meaning of the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets. You can also gain knowledge by watching and listening to others, especially Church leaders. Like Nephi, you can say: “My soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them. . . . Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard” (2 Nephi 4:15–16). #### Scripture Study (Page 133) - How does knowledge assist in doing the Lord’s work? - Alma 17:2–3, D&C 88:77–80 - How can you obtain knowledge? - 2 Nephi 32:1–5, Moroni 10:5, D&C 42:61, D&C 76:5–10, D&C 88:118 - Bible Dictionary, “Knowledge” Topical Guide, “Knowledge” ## Patience (Page 134) Patience is the capacity to endure delay trouble, opposition, or suffering without becoming angry, frustrated, or anxious. It is the ability to do God’s will and accept His timing. When you are patient, you hold up under pressure and are able to face adversity calmly and hopefully. Patience is related to hope and faith—you must wait for the Lord’s promised blessings to be fulfilled. You need patience in your everyday experiences and relationships, especially with your companion. You must be patient with all people, yourself included, as you work to overcome faults and weaknesses. “Life is full of difficulties, some minor and others of a more serious nature. There seems to be an unending supply of challenges for one and all. Our problem is that we often expect instantaneous solutions to such challenges, forgetting that frequently the heavenly virtue of patience is required.” – PRESIDENT THOMAS S.

What were the desires of the sons of Mosiah? - What was the Lord’s counsel to those missionaries? (See Alma 17:10–11 and 26:27.) - What were some results of their patience and diligence? (See Alma 26.) - Write your answers in your study journal. #### Scripture Study (Page 134) - Why is patience important? How are patience and faith related? - Mosiah 23:21, Mosiah 24:9–16, Alma 31:31, Alma 32:41–43 - Alma 34:40–41, D&C 101:38, Romans 5:3–5, Romans 8:24–25 - 2 Corinthians 6:1–10, James 5:10–11, Psalm 46:10, Topical Guide, “Patience, Patient, Patiently” ## Humility (Page 134) Humility is willingness to submit to the will of the Lord and to give the Lord the honor for what is accomplished. It includes gratitude for His blessings and acknowledgment of your constant need for His divine help. Humility is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of spiritual strength. When you humbly trust Him and acknowledge His power and mercy, you can have the assurance that His commandments are for your good. You are confident that you can do whatever the Lord requires of you if you rely on Him. You are also willing to trust His chosen servants and follow their counsel. Humility will help you as you strive to be obedient, to work hard, and serve selflessly. The opposite of humility is pride, which is condemned in the scriptures. To be prideful means to put greater trust in oneself than in God or in His servants. It also means to put the things of the world above the things of God. Prideful people take honor to themselves rather than giving God the glory. Pride is competitive; those who are prideful seek to have more and presume they are better than other people. Pride usually results']","In 1 Peter, Peter teaches about virtues such as charity, humility, and patience, emphasizing the importance of moral standards and trusting in God's timing. Joseph Smith’s vision, where he saw the Father and the Son, revealed that many churches were wrong and that true authority comes from divine revelation and priesthood restoration. Combining these, we learn that to be good and effective missionaries, we need to develop virtues like charity and humility, trust in divine guidance as Joseph did, and rely on the restored gospel and priesthood authority. This helps us understand that following Christ’s example and teachings, as Peter encourages, along with the divine witness Joseph received, enables us to serve more sincerely and effectively today.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does Doctrine and Covenants 88:124 relate to helping investigators keep commitments and prepare for baptism according to the message of the Restoration?,"['<1-hop>\n\n(30–60 minutes, if applicable), If learning a new language, study the language (30–60 minutes). You are encouraged to study English if you are a non-English speaker, Eat lunch and dinner (no more than two hours combined). | |9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing, unless you have a teaching appointment; if so, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | *Your daily activities should focus on interacting with people. Spread your planning and study activities throughout the day to avoid spending long periods of time in your apartment. If distance and time permit, you may leave and return to your apartment throughout the day to meet these needs. The schedule approved for your mission will allow time to work, rest, and refocus. It is important to get adequate rest and nutrition for your spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. > 2.4.3 ### Goal Setting and Planning Sessions Hold daily and weekly planning sessions with your companion. Consider the needs of those you are teaching and how to work with members as you review progress, set goals, and make plans for the day and for the week (see “How to Set Goals,” “The Weekly Planning Session,” and “Daily Planning Session” in “How Do I Use Time Wisely?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 8). > 2.4.4 ### Study Sessions Use your personal and companion study time to focus on the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets (found in Gospel Library), and these standards. These approved resources can strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. If you have been assigned to learn a new language, study and practice it daily. If you are a new missionary, study with your trainer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes each day for the first 12 weeks in the mission field (see “For New Missionaries: Additional Companion Study” in “Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel?” in Preach My Gospel). > 2.4.5 ### Meals with Others If applicable, your mission president and the local stake president will provide guidelines for scheduling meals with people in your mission. When members or others provide meals: - Be respectful of their personal situations and time. - Be grateful for the food they offer. - Ask to teach a 15- or 20-minute lesson before or after the meal to strengthen those you visit and to provide you with an opportunity to improve your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Another adult of your own gender should be present with you and your companion when you eat a meal with someone of the opposite gender. > 2.5 ## Preparation Day Your mission president will assign one day each week as a preparation day. Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing. If you have a teaching appointment, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | > 2.6 ## Sabbath Day Activities Plan activities on the Sabbath that help you fulfill your missionary purpose to find, teach, baptize, and help others learn about and become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). You', '<2-hop>\n\nthe message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital. There may be times when you call the investigators to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment. Help investigators identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message. Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments. Investigators are changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are with them. Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 215) - Write in your daily planner your plans for daily contact with each investigator. Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with investigators. - Choose one commitment invitation you will extend when you teach the lessons. Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment. Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns. #### Remember This (Page 215) - Focus on inviting people to make commitments in every finding or teaching situation, both with those who are not members of the Church and with Church members. - Extend commitment invitations to help people experience conversion. - Promise blessings. - Bear testimony. - Follow through to help people keep commitments. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 216) ### Personal Study (Page 216) - Identify a commandment listed in either lesson 4 or 5. Think of the blessings you have received from obeying this commandment, and write them in your journal. - In a letter, ask your family members how they have been blessed by obeying a specific commandment (for example, tithing). - Write how you feel about extending commitments. Are you bold or timid? Are you confident that people will be blessed, or do you have doubts? Are you consistent, patient, and helpful as you make daily contact? Do the people know you love them? How can you correct any weakness you identify in your invitations? - Review your lesson plans for each lesson. Do you include specific commitments? Does your lesson plan lead clearly to commitments? ### Companion Study (Page 216) - From your daily planner, make a list of people you have contacted in the past two days, including investigators and members. For each person, write the commitment(s) they made and other invitations you could have or should have extended. Discuss why you were able to obtain commitments from some of these people and what prevented you from obtaining commitments from others. What will you do to follow up on these commitments? - Look at your daily planner, and write the names of specific investigators you will teach in the next day or two. Consider which commandment(s) listed in lessons 4 and 5 you will invite them to live. Discuss how you will extend the commitment and the specific blessings you will promise for obedience. - Consider showing the Teaching Record to investigators to let them know what will be expected. If appropriate, share a copy with them. - Review the Notes/To Do List in your planner for the past three days to see if you have written your assignments to follow up on every invitation you have extended. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 216) - Discuss effective and creative ideas for daily contact with investigators. How have missionaries worked with members effectively? What printed or audiovisual materials are useful? What can you do when people are not home or are too busy to see you? - Discuss ways that missionaries have effectively taught the commandments in lessons 4 and 5. - Discuss specific concerns of some current investigators. What are the nature of these concerns? What can the missionaries do to resolve the concerns? ### Mission President (Page 216) - Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach. Help them focus on helping people make and keep commitments. - Encourage priesthood leaders and members to actively participate in making daily contact with investigators. - Be an example of extending invitations in your missionary efforts and with the missionaries you serve. > Beginning of chapter 12 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation? (Page 217) #### Consider This (Page 217) - What do I need to do to help prepare people for baptism and confirmation? - How do I conduct an effective baptismal interview? - How is a spiritual baptismal service planned and conducted? - How do I work closely with the bishop to ensure that converts are confirmed? - Why is it important to complete baptismal and confirmation records? ## Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 217) The purpose of your teaching is to help others develop faith in Jesus Christ and repent of their sins. As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (Moroni 8:25). The baptismal interview is the way established by the Church to ensure that each candidate meets the Lord’s standards for baptism and is prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Through this interview, baptismal candidates fulfill the scriptural requirement that they witness before an authorized representative of the Church that they have “truly repented of all their sins” (D&C 20:37). The commitments that investigators make prepare them to make and keep the covenant of baptism. People who have kept the commitments that you invited them to make will be well prepared for the interview and for membership and activity in the Church. As you teach investigators and prepare them for baptism and confirmation, make sure that they meet the qualifications for baptism. #### Qualifications for Baptism (Page 218) 1. **Doctrine and Covenants 20:37:**']","Doctrine and Covenants 88:124 emphasizes the importance of retiring early and getting adequate rest to maintain spiritual and physical well-being, which supports the message of the Restoration by encouraging missionaries and investigators to stay spiritually alert and prepared. This aligns with the themes of helping investigators keep commitments and develop faith, as both emphasize the need for spiritual discipline and proper preparation to be ready for baptism and to receive the Holy Ghost, as taught in the message of the Restoration and supported by the principles outlined in Doctrine and Covenants 88:124.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
