Who is John in the context of the missionary training and what role does he play?,"['Your Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47).

Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9).

This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission']","The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22).",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Who is Moroni according to the context?,"['Your Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11).

You should sleep in the same room but not the same bed. When doing individual tasks while in your housing, use common sense to protect yourselves and follow missionary standards of behavior (see 3.0). Do not create time to be alone. For example, do not stay up later or get up earlier than your companion. If you and your companion become separated, contact your mission president immediately. > 2.2.3 ### Working in Your Area “Go and labor with [your] mights” (Jacob 5:72), and concentrate your efforts in your assigned teaching area. Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88). You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2). If you need to leave your area for another reason, request permission from your district leader to leave your area within your district or from your zone leaders if you need to travel outside of your district. You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone. If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead.

Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary.

What is the role of the Gospel Library for missionaries?,"['Missionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members.

For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion.

Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings.

Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties.

With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work.

In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip.

If you have been assigned to learn a new language, study and practice it daily. If you are a new missionary, study with your trainer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes each day for the first 12 weeks in the mission field (see “For New Missionaries: Additional Companion Study” in “Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel?” in Preach My Gospel). > 2.4.5 ### Meals with Others If applicable, your mission president and the local stake president will provide guidelines for scheduling meals with people in your mission.

Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing.

Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did.

In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17).

This relates to working diligently and with faith as described in the context. Additionally, Doctrine and Covenants 10:4 emphasizes the importance of planning, working smart, and taking care of your physical and spiritual well-being through rest and proper scheduling.

You should sleep in the same room but not the same bed. When doing individual tasks while in your housing, use common sense to protect yourselves and follow missionary standards of behavior (see 3.0). Do not create time to be alone. For example, do not stay up later or get up earlier than your companion. If you and your companion become separated, contact your mission president immediately. > 2.2.3 ### Working in Your Area “Go and labor with [your] mights” (Jacob 5:72), and concentrate your efforts in your assigned teaching area. Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88). You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2). If you need to leave your area for another reason, request permission from your district leader to leave your area within your district or from your zone leaders if you need to travel outside of your district. You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone. If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders. - In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer. - District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district. - Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone. - Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones. - Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president. - A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should: - Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate. - Plan the companion exchange in advance. - Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping. - Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel. - Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching. - Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve. - Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement. - Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange. - Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president. > 2.3.2 ### Transfers The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office. - If your companion is transferred and you are', '<2-hop>\n\n(30–60 minutes, if applicable), If learning a new language, study the language (30–60 minutes).

Spread your planning and study activities throughout the day to avoid spending long periods of time in your apartment. If distance and time permit, you may leave and return to your apartment throughout the day to meet these needs. The schedule approved for your mission will allow time to work, rest, and refocus. It is important to get adequate rest and nutrition for your spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. > 2.4.3 ### Goal Setting and Planning Sessions Hold daily and weekly planning sessions with your companion. Consider the needs of those you are teaching and how to work with members as you review progress, set goals, and make plans for the day and for the week (see “How to Set Goals,” “The Weekly Planning Session,” and “Daily Planning Session” in “How Do I Use Time Wisely?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 8). > 2.4.4 ### Study Sessions Use your personal and companion study time to focus on the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets (found in Gospel Library), and these standards. These approved resources can strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. If you have been assigned to learn a new language, study and practice it daily. If you are a new missionary, study with your trainer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes each day for the first 12 weeks in the mission field (see “For New Missionaries: Additional Companion Study” in “Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel?” in Preach My Gospel). > 2.4.5 ### Meals with Others If applicable, your mission president and the local stake president will provide guidelines for scheduling meals with people in your mission. When members or others provide meals: - Be respectful of their personal situations and time. - Be grateful for the food they offer. - Ask to teach a 15- or 20-minute lesson before or after the meal to strengthen those you visit and to provide you with an opportunity to improve your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Another adult of your own gender should be present with you and your companion when you eat a meal with someone of the opposite gender. > 2.5 ## Preparation Day Your mission president will assign one day each week as a preparation day. Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing.

Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary.

Moroni how does he teach Christlike behavior and how does that relate to full-time mission experience according to the context?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with', '<2-hop>\n\nYour Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission']","Moroni teaches Christlike behavior by emphasizing the importance of developing Christlike attributes such as kindness, humility, patience, and obedience, and by encouraging missionaries to respect others, be honest, and act in ways that reflect the Savior’s love.

Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards.

This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission']","Mosiah's counsel emphasizes developing Christlike attributes such as kindness, humility, and obedience, which are essential for maintaining temple worthiness and practicing honesty.

As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion.

A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33).

"Hwo does Mosiah 18:9 relate to the Christlike behavior and temple covenants discussed in the missionary standards, and how can these principles help missionaries be more obedient and respectful in their service?","['<1-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded.

Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health.

Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with', '<2-hop>\n\n(30–60 minutes, if applicable), If learning a new language, study the language (30–60 minutes). You are encouraged to study English if you are a non-English speaker, Eat lunch and dinner (no more than two hours combined). | |9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing, unless you have a teaching appointment; if so, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | *Your daily activities should focus on interacting with people. Spread your planning and study activities throughout the day to avoid spending long periods of time in your apartment. If distance and time permit, you may leave and return to your apartment throughout the day to meet these needs. The schedule approved for your mission will allow time to work, rest, and refocus. It is important to get adequate rest and nutrition for your spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. > 2.4.3 ### Goal Setting and Planning Sessions Hold daily and weekly planning sessions with your companion. Consider the needs of those you are teaching and how to work with members as you review progress, set goals, and make plans for the day and for the week (see “How to Set Goals,” “The Weekly Planning Session,” and “Daily Planning Session” in “How Do I Use Time Wisely?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 8). > 2.4.4 ### Study Sessions Use your personal and companion study time to focus on the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets (found in Gospel Library), and these standards. These approved resources can strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. If you have been assigned to learn a new language, study and practice it daily. If you are a new missionary, study with your trainer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes each day for the first 12 weeks in the mission field (see “For New Missionaries: Additional Companion Study” in “Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel?” in Preach My Gospel). > 2.4.5 ### Meals with Others If applicable, your mission president and the local stake president will provide guidelines for scheduling meals with people in your mission. When members or others provide meals: - Be respectful of their personal situations and time. - Be grateful for the food they offer. - Ask to teach a 15- or 20-minute lesson before or after the meal to strengthen those you visit and to provide you with an opportunity to improve your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Another adult of your own gender should be present with you and your companion when you eat a meal with someone of the opposite gender. > 2.5 ## Preparation Day Your mission president will assign one day each week as a preparation day. Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing. If you have a teaching appointment, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | > 2.6 ## Sabbath Day Activities Plan activities on the Sabbath that help you fulfill your missionary purpose to find, teach, baptize, and help others learn about and become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). You']","Mosiah 18:9 emphasizes the importance of standing as witnesses of God at all times and in all places, which relates to the missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities described in the context. These standards include developing Christlike attributes, respecting others, and maintaining temple worthiness, all of which align with the principles in Mosiah 18:9 about living as a dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ during missionary service.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone.

They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts.

This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission.

Together, these principles support missionaries in maintaining honesty, respecting local customs, and building trustful relationships as they serve in accordance with the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints how do they teach Christlike behavior and keep temple covenants?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with', '<2-hop>\n\nis a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders. Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately. For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings.

Spread your planning and study activities throughout the day to avoid spending long periods of time in your apartment. If distance and time permit, you may leave and return to your apartment throughout the day to meet these needs. The schedule approved for your mission will allow time to work, rest, and refocus. It is important to get adequate rest and nutrition for your spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. > 2.4.3 ### Goal Setting and Planning Sessions Hold daily and weekly planning sessions with your companion. Consider the needs of those you are teaching and how to work with members as you review progress, set goals, and make plans for the day and for the week (see “How to Set Goals,” “The Weekly Planning Session,” and “Daily Planning Session” in “How Do I Use Time Wisely?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 8). > 2.4.4 ### Study Sessions Use your personal and companion study time to focus on the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets (found in Gospel Library), and these standards. These approved resources can strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. If you have been assigned to learn a new language, study and practice it daily. If you are a new missionary, study with your trainer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes each day for the first 12 weeks in the mission field (see “For New Missionaries: Additional Companion Study” in “Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel?” in Preach My Gospel). > 2.4.5 ### Meals with Others If applicable, your mission president and the local stake president will provide guidelines for scheduling meals with people in your mission. When members or others provide meals: - Be respectful of their personal situations and time. - Be grateful for the food they offer. - Ask to teach a 15- or 20-minute lesson before or after the meal to strengthen those you visit and to provide you with an opportunity to improve your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Another adult of your own gender should be present with you and your companion when you eat a meal with someone of the opposite gender. > 2.5 ## Preparation Day Your mission president will assign one day each week as a preparation day. Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing. If you have a teaching appointment, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | > 2.6 ## Sabbath Day Activities Plan activities on the Sabbath that help you fulfill your missionary purpose to find, teach, baptize, and help others learn about and become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). You', '<2-hop>\n\nYour Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission']","Mosiah 18:9 emphasizes the importance of standing as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, which aligns with the missionary's commitment to obedience and service.

It is important to get adequate rest and nutrition for your spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. > 2.4.3 ### Goal Setting and Planning Sessions Hold daily and weekly planning sessions with your companion. Consider the needs of those you are teaching and how to work with members as you review progress, set goals, and make plans for the day and for the week (see “How to Set Goals,” “The Weekly Planning Session,” and “Daily Planning Session” in “How Do I Use Time Wisely?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 8). > 2.4.4 ### Study Sessions Use your personal and companion study time to focus on the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets (found in Gospel Library), and these standards.

Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing.

Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). You', '<2-hop>\n\nYour Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles.

Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). You', '<2-hop>\n\nYour Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission']","Mosiah 2:17 states, ""When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."" This verse underscores the significance of serving others as a fundamental aspect of missionary work. In the context of missionary training, service in the community is highlighted as a way to emulate Jesus Christ and fulfill the missionary purpose of finding, teaching, and helping others learn about Him. The daily activities, such as teaching, planning, and engaging with members and community members, are all opportunities to serve and demonstrate Christlike love. By applying Mosiah 2:17, missionaries are encouraged to view their service as an act of worship and devotion to God, guiding their interactions to be respectful, compassionate, and selfless, thereby strengthening their faith and effectiveness in their missionary efforts.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

"How does the full-time missionary experience, which emphasizes obedience and following Jesus Christ, relate to maintaining physical well-being and safety during service?","['<1-hop>\n\nYour Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission', '<2-hop>\n\nPhysical Well-Being > 4.0 ## Introduction Missionary work requires physical and emotional commitment. The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion.

This obedience extends to caring for their physical well-being, such as following proper nutrition, safe food preparation, and exercise guidelines, as well as managing stress and seeking medical care when needed. By adhering to these standards, missionaries can better serve with strength and safety, ensuring they remain healthy and capable of fulfilling their spiritual and organizational responsibilities, all while exemplifying the love and obedience taught by Jesus Christ.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46).

"How does Jesus Christ influence the standards for physical well-being and obedience in missionary service, and how are these standards connected to His teachings?","['<1-hop>\n\nYour Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission', '<2-hop>\n\nPhysical Well-Being > 4.0 ## Introduction Missionary work requires physical and emotional commitment. The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe.

For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe.

A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles.

A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life.

With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders.

With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders.

It also highlights that dedicating oneself to God's standards and commandments throughout life is an invitation from Jesus Christ to become a lifelong disciple.

A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president.

You have been called by revelation through God’s chosen servants to assist the Apostles in this great work of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world in order to make disciples of all nations. When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6). To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you.

As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake.

You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water.

For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe. If there', '<2-hop>\n\nis a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders. Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately. For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings.

These practical guidelines support missionaries in staying healthy and resilient, enabling them to serve effectively. The themes of Jesus Christ are reflected in the overall approach to well-being and safety, as missionaries are encouraged to embody His teachings by caring for their bodies, practicing safety, and demonstrating responsibility. This holistic approach aligns with the principle that embodying the Savior’s example involves both spiritual devotion and responsible, healthful actions in daily life, thereby exemplifying His love and care through practical means during their service.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

How does the mission emphasize the importance of Jesus Christ in maintaining physical well-being and handling stressful situations?,"['<1-hop>\n\nPhysical Well-Being > 4.0 ## Introduction Missionary work requires physical and emotional commitment. The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe. If there', '<2-hop>\n\nis a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders. Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately. For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders.

Specifically, the context references that the Lord will support and help missionaries who seek Him, quoting 2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17, which teaches faith and reliance on Jesus Christ during difficult times. This spiritual foundation encourages missionaries to manage stress through prayer, pondering, and studying, aligning their physical and emotional health with their faith in Jesus Christ as the source of strength and comfort.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
