There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes),']","The First Presidency's message in Preach My Gospel compliments missionaries on their work, emphasizes the importance of their role in helping bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man, and encourages them to study the scriptures, learn doctrines and principles, and serve humbly and prayerfully to be better missionaries. They highlight that every missionary's work is important and that the Lord will reward and bless those who serve faithfully.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
How does Preach My Gospel serve as a resource for missionaries to prepare and teach effectively during their service?,"['and prepare for the day. - 7:30 a.m. Breakfast. - 8:00 a.m. Personal study: the Book of Mormon, other scriptures, doctrines of the missionary lessons, other chapters from Preach My Gospel, the Missionary Handbook, and the Missionary Health Guide. - 9:00 a.m. Companion study: share what you have learned during personal study, prepare to teach, practice teaching, study chapters from Preach My Gospel, confirm plans for the day. - 10:00 a.m. Begin proselyting. Missionaries learning a language study that language for an additional 30 to 60 minutes, including planning language learning activities to use during the day. Missionaries may take an hour for lunch and additional study, and an hour for dinner at times during the day that fit best with their proselyting. Normally dinner should be finished no later than 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. Return to living quarters (unless teaching a lesson; then return by 9:30) and plan the next day’s activities (30 minutes). Write in journal, prepare for bed, pray. - 10:30 p.m. Retire to bed. \\*In consultation with the Presidency of the Seventy or the Area Presidency, your mission president may modify this schedule to meet local circumstances. What you learn in personal study will help you in companion study, district meeting, and zone conferences, where you can “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). What you gain from your study sessions and district meetings will help you teach with spiritual power. ### Personal Study (page 10) The purpose of personal study is to strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. In your personal study, focus on the standard works and the approved missionary library: - Jesus the Christ - Our Heritage - Our Search for Happiness - True to the Faith You can make personal study effective as you: - Read from the Book of Mormon and other scriptures. - Study the doctrines of the missionary lessons. - Study other chapters from Preach My Gospel. ### Companion Study (Page 11) The purpose of companion study is to (1) build unity in your companionship in order to teach by the Spirit and (2) focus on the progress of those you teach. You can make companion study effective as you: - Share insights with each other from personal study. - Prepare for specific teaching appointments, member visits, finding opportunities, and other activities. Study material that helps you teach, find, and work more effectively. Discuss the people with whom you are working. Make plans to apply what you are learning. - Throughout the day, continue to discuss the principles, goals, skills, and plans from companion study. ### District Meetings (Page 11) The purpose of district meeting is to “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). - District meetings are held each week for 60 to 90 minutes. - The district leader plans and conducts the district meeting and may invite other missionaries to help teach. - District meetings may include: – Sharing insights from personal and companion study. – Practicing the lessons in various settings. – Explaining, demonstrating, and practicing principles and skills described in Preach My Gospel. – Discussing the progress and needs of investigators. – Discussing and addressing challenges in the district. – Sharing experiences and testimonies of missionary work. - District leaders may use district meeting to receive reports regarding the efforts of missionaries in the district. They should not set goals or quotas for other missionaries. ### Zone Conferences (Page 11) Zone conferences are held under the direction of the mission president. ### Study Journal (Page 12) Preach My Gospel frequently asks that you use a study journal to help you understand, clarify, and remember what you are learning. Elder Richard G. Scott taught, “Knowledge carefully recorded is knowledge available in time of need. Spiritually sensitive information should be kept in a sacred place that communicates to the Lord how you treasure it. This practice enhances the likelihood of your receiving further light” (“Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge,” Ensign, Nov. 1993, 86). Review your study journal to recall spiritual experiences, see new insights, and recognize your growth. Your study journal may be a bound journal, a notebook, or a binder. Record and organize your thoughts and impressions in a way that fits how you learn. Develop your own system to easily access key information in the future. Use it often to review, access, and apply what you have learned. Use your study journal to take notes and record impressions during your personal and companion study, district meetings, zone conferences, and interviews with the mission president. ### Ideas for Study and Application (Page 13) Each chapter concludes with additional ideas for personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. This rich resource of learning activities provides examples of effective ways to learn the material. Be creative and seek inspiration to create additional activities each time you study or teach one of these sections. Complete these activities several times during your mission. ## Missionaries Serving in Branches and Districts (Page 13) Many missionaries serve in branches and districts. Although this manual refers to wards and stakes, the same principles and approaches apply to branches and districts. The mission president will instruct you on any adjustments to make when working with branch and district leaders. ## Use by Ward Missionaries and Leaders (Page 13) Preach My Gospel is for the full-time missionaries of the Church. However, the principles and doctrines taught herein are also applicable to ward missionaries and leaders as they seek to build the Lord’s kingdom. Frequent study of this manual will enable them to fulfill their responsibilities as member missionaries and will foster unity with the full-time missionaries. > Beginning of Chapter 1 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Is My Purpose as a Missionary?

It emphasizes the importance of studying scriptures, doctrines, and principles to strengthen knowledge and testimony. The manual also offers ideas for study and application, encourages creativity, and highlights the significance of recording impressions and spiritual experiences. It is designed to help missionaries prepare to teach with spiritual power and to build unity and effectiveness in their missionary work.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Who is Lehi?,"['and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ### Consider This (Page 15) - What is my purpose as a missionary? - What is the gospel? - Why do we preach the gospel? - Why must I teach with power and authority? - What is the message of the Restoration? Why is it so important? - What is my responsibility in helping others become converted? - How will I know whether I am a successful missionary? > Questions to help study this chapter by looking for the answers ## Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 15) You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. All of them are children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (D&C 59:23), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of guilt that come from mistakes and sins. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (2 Nephi 2:6, 8). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, Title Page). As your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great . . . importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (2 Nephi 2:8). President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world. That is the cause that must unite us today. Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167). You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. To come to the Savior they must have faith in Him unto repentance— making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenants of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). ### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11. In this vision, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God (see 1 Nephi 11:21–22). - In the vision, what did the people need to do to be able to partake of the fruit? What do we need to do to receive all the blessings of the Atonement? In what ways do commitments and covenants help us partake of these blessings? - As a missionary, what is your duty in helping others find and partake of the fruits of the gospel? - What did Lehi desire after he had eaten the fruit? (See 1 Nephi 8:10–18.) ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 17) The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for families: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational']","The context does not provide specific information about Lehi other than mentioning that as people accept the restored gospel and ordinances, they can be assured of being not cast off forever, and that understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, increasing the desire to share the gospel like Lehi did. It also quotes Lehi's desire after eating the fruit in the vision, but does not specify who he is. Therefore, based solely on the provided content, Lehi is referenced as a figure who felt the importance of making the gospel known and desired the blessings of the Atonement, but no detailed description of who he is is given in the context.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"How is Joseph Smith related to the activities described in the context, and why is his name misspelled in the long discussion?","['activities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ## The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power?

As you study the doctrines in the missionary lessons, you will come to see that we have one message: Through a modern prophet, God has restored knowledge about the plan of salvation, which is centered on Christ’s Atonement and fulfilled by living the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Make sure that everyone you teach clearly understands the following: - God is our literal Father in Heaven. He loves us. Every person on earth is a child of God and a member of God’s family. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior and Redeemer. - Our loving Father in Heaven reached out to His children throughout biblical history by revealing His gospel to prophets. Sadly, many people rejected that gospel; even some of those who accepted it changed gospel doctrines and ordinances and fell into unbelief and apostasy. - Our Father in Heaven sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. He performed miracles and taught His gospel. He accomplished the Atonement and was resurrected. - Beginning with the First Vision, God has again reached out in love to His children. He restored the gospel of Jesus Christ and His priesthood authority and organized His Church on the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence of this Restoration. As you help investigators see the pattern of apostasy and restoration, they will be prepared to understand the great need for the latter-day Restoration. They will see the need to accept the restored gospel, receive the ordinances of salvation by the authority of the restored priesthood, and follow the way to eternal life. Help people recognize that the Church is not just another religion, nor is it an American church. Rather, it is a restoration of the “fulness of [the] gospel” (D&C 1:23), the same as was revealed and taught from the beginning. The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. It is the keystone of our religion, the most powerful resource for teaching this message.']","The context references 3 Nephi as part of scriptures that provide answers about the gospel of Jesus Christ, specifically in passages like 3 Nephi 27:13–22 and 3 Nephi 11:31–41. It is included among the scriptures that help explain the purpose of the gospel, which is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. The teachings in 3 Nephi emphasize the importance of faith, repentance, baptism, and enduring to the end, all central to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. The restoration of the gospel and priesthood authority, which includes the teachings in 3 Nephi, is presented as evidence of the fulfillment of God's plan and the need for individuals to accept the restored gospel to return to God's presence.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Joseph Smith ke bare me ka bata sakte ho ki wo kya important sachaiyan restore kiya tha aur wo kaise logon ke dil me prabhav daalta hai?,"['Some important truths restored through Joseph Smith include the knowledge that God is our Father and that we are His spirit children, that we lived with Him before birth, and that families can live together forever in God’s presence through Christ’s Atonement by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel. The Book of Mormon is evidence of the love of God for His children. It shows that God speaks to His children. As you teach and testify, invite people to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its message. Each person you teach must decide whether to accept the Book of Mormon as revelation from God. Trust the remarkable promise in Moroni 10:3–5. Do all you can to persuade people to read the book, understand it, and ask God sincerely whether it is true. The witness of the Holy Ghost becomes the cornerstone of their faith that Christ has restored His Church. Help those you teach to receive that spiritual confirmation. #### Scripture Study (Page 22) How should you use the Book of Mormon in your missionary work? - Read 1 Nephi 13:39 2 Nephi 29:8–10, Moroni 10:3–5 D&C 20:5–16, D&C 42:12–14 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 22) Imagine that you are going to write an article about the message of the Restoration for a local newspaper. In your study journal write a title that describes the central message. Then record your thoughts and feelings about this message, including how understanding it better has changed the way you live and the way you view the world around you. ## Helping Others Make Commitments: The Door to Faith and Repentance (Page 22) Help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “The first thing you will do when an investigator tells you he or she had not read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! . . . Much of the time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the balance. . . . It is the most important path this investigator will ever walk. But if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! . . . So take control of this situation. Teach with power and authority, and then be devastated if the first steps toward commandment-keeping and covenant-keeping have not been successfully begun” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1997). As you teach people to understand the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel, you “declare repentance” (D&C 15:6). Repentance involves a change of heart and a desire to forsake sin and serve God. It involves humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to God’s will. It requires that people increase their commitment to live in agreement with God’s will. Repentance requires a sincere and lasting change of thoughts, desires, habits, and actions. It is a positive experience that brings joy and peace. Be bold and loving in helping people understand what they must do to repent. By inviting people to make commitments, you can effectively raise a voice of both warning and hope. #### Scripture Study (Page 22) What do these scriptures teach about declaring repentance? - Read Alma 29:1–4 Alma 42:31, Alma 62:45 D&C 14:8, and D&C 15:6; 16:6 for answersto the question. ## Baptism and Confirmation (Page 23) Baptizing and confirming the people you teach is central to your purpose. Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost brings a host of blessings to those who live worthy of it. Through these ordinances people enter the gate and continue on the path to eternal life. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said: “We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church. We do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives. . . . We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the sons and daughters of God. No one else can do this” (“The Purpose of Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1995). As you teach the restored gospel, help people understand the sacred nature of baptism and confirmation. Help them realize that receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is a great blessing in this life and a key to their salvation. The Holy Ghost will “teach [them] all things” (John 14:26). President Boyd K. Packer taught: “When you are teaching investigators and preparing them for baptism by water, you must also think of the gift of the Holy Ghost— baptism by fire. Think of it as one sentence. First comes the baptism of water and then the baptism of fire” (“The Gift of the Holy Ghost: What Every Missionary Should Know—and Every Member As Well,” seminar for new mission presidents, June 2003). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 5:499). Help those you teach understand that to qualify for baptism and confirmation they must meet the conditions given in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. ### D&C 20:37 Qualifications for Baptism (page 23) - Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Are willing to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins.

"How does Mosiah relate to the process of baptism and confirmation as described in the context, and what significance does it hold for worthy converts in their spiritual journey?","['worthy converts are baptized, they are confirmed members of the Church and the gift of the Holy Ghost is conferred upon them. This confirmation occurs under the direction of the bishop or branch president in a sacrament meeting soon after the baptism. While the two ordinances are separated by a brief time, confirmation complements and completes baptism. #### Scripture Study (Page 24) 1. In what ways is the gift of the Holy Ghost one of the greatest gifts we can receive? - Read 3 Nephi 19:1–13, D&C 45:56–57, John 3:5, John 14:26, Galatians 5:22–25, and Topical Guide: “Holy Ghost, Gift of” for answers to the question. 2. Why should converts desire the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Read 2 Nephi 31:12–17, 2 Nephi 32:1–5, Acts 8:14–17 and Acts 19:1–6 for answers to the question. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 24) Search the following scriptures and make a list of the qualifications and covenant of baptism. Discuss with your companion how to teach those requirements to others. - 2 Nephi 31:13 Mosiah 18:8–10 - Alma 7:14–16 3 Nephi 11:21–41 - Moroni 6:1–4 D&C 20:37 ## Establishing the Church (Page 24) When people have been baptized and confirmed members of the Church, continue to work with ward leaders and members to help these new converts adjust to their new life and continue their spiritual growth. The Church is established as people who have testimonies are baptized and confirmed, keep their covenants, prepare actively to go to the temple, and help strengthen the ward or branch. Converts who have member friends, who are given responsibility, and who are nourished by God’s word will grow in testimony and faith. Missionaries, ward leaders, and Church members should not turn away from their responsibility to nourish and strengthen new members. ## A Successful Missionary (Page 24) Your success as a missionary is measured primarily by your commitment to find, teach, baptize, and confirm people and to help them become faithful members of the Church who enjoy the presence of the Holy Ghost. Avoid comparing yourself to other missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts against theirs. Remember that people have agency to choose whether to accept your message. Your responsibility is to teach clearly and powerfully so they can make a correct choice. Some may not accept your message even when they have received a spiritual witness that it is true. You will be saddened because you love them and desire their salvation. You should not, however, become discouraged; discouragement will weaken your faith. If you lower your expectations, your effectiveness will decrease, your desire will weaken, and you will have greater difficulty following the Spirit. You can know you have been a successful missionary when you: - Feel the Spirit testify to people through you. - Love people and desire their salvation. - Obey with exactness. - Live so that you can receive and know how to follow the Spirit, who will show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Develop Christlike attributes. - Work effectively every day, do your very best to bring souls to Christ, and seek earnestly to learn and improve. - Help build up the Church (the ward) wherever you are assigned to work. - Warn people of the consequences of sin. Invite them to make and keep commitments. - Teach and serve other missionaries. - Go about doing good and serving people at every opportunity, whether or not they accept your message. When you have done your very best, you may still experience disappointments, but you will not be disappointed in yourself. You can feel certain that the Lord is pleased when you feel the Spirit working through you. #### Scripture Study (Page 25) How do servants of the Lord feel about the work? How do servants of the Lord influence those they serve? - Read Mosiah 28:3, Alma 8:14–15, Helaman 10:3–5, 3 Nephi 28:4–10, Ether 12:13–15, D&C 15:4–6, D&C 16:4–6 and D&C 68:2–6 for the answers to the questions. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 25) - Read Helaman 10:1–5 and 3 Nephi 7:17–18. How did the Lord feel about these missionaries and their service? - Think about the missionary efforts of Abinadi and Ammon (see Mosiah 11–18; Alma 17–20, 23–24). Why were both missionaries successful even though the immediate results of their efforts were different? - Record what you learn in your study journal. ### Remember This (Page 25) - Your purpose is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. - The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way by which we can find eternal happiness. - Your calling gives you authority; keeping your covenants gives you power. - The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. - You help people live the gospel by inviting them to make and keep commitments. - You show your love for the Lord and gratitude for His Atonement by bringing souls unto Him. - You are successful when you are obedient, live righteously, and do your best in helping others live the gospel. ## Missionary Work (Page 26) Following are statements made by Presidents of the Church in this dispensation. ### President Joseph Smith (1830–1844) (Page 26) “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 113). “Let the Saints remember that great things depend on their individual exertion, and that they are called to be co-workers with us and the Holy Spirit in accomplishing the great work of the last days” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 178–79). ### President Brigham Young (1847–1877) (Page 26) “There is neither man or woman in this Church who is not']","The context explains that worthy converts are baptized and then confirmed members of the Church, with the gift of the Holy Ghost conferred upon them under the direction of the bishop or branch president. While baptism and confirmation are separate ordinances, confirmation complements and completes baptism. Although the specific mention of Mosiah in the context is limited, the scriptures listed for study include Mosiah 18:8–10, which discusses the covenant of baptism. This indicates that Mosiah's teachings are relevant to understanding the requirements and covenants associated with baptism, emphasizing its importance in the spiritual growth and establishment of new members in the Church.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

How does Moroni 10:4 relate to studying the gospel?,"['new members. > Beginning of Chapter 2 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach? (Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 32) Read Joseph Smith—History 1:11–13. Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.” – PRESIDENT BOYD K.

How does the context emphasize teaching about Jesus Christ to strengthen faith and prepare others for baptism?,"['the baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). #### Defining Words (Page 35) We have a powerful message with a unique vocabulary.

What is covered in chapter 3?,"['definitions and terms in the ”Ideas for Teaching“ section of each lesson. Become familiar with the definitions provided. Use True to the Faith and the Bible Dictionary to find definitions for other words. Write these definitions in your study journal. Share the definitions with your companion and others to see if you understand. If the definitions are unclear to others, revise your definitions based on the material you have studied. As you teach, seek to discern whether a word or principle is new to the person you are teaching. Take time to explain unfamiliar words or principles. Remember to teach for understanding so that you and those you teach “are edified and rejoice together” (D&C 50:22). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 35) Turn to the lesson “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ” located in chapter 3. Read the list of key definitions in the “Ideas for Teaching” section. Locate three other words in the lesson that you would like to define. Follow the suggestions given above in creating a definition for each. ## Study Ideas and Suggestions (Page 36) Each of the ideas and suggestions in this section can make your study time more rewarding and spiritually uplifting. Consider the following as you plan your study: - Always begin with a prayer. - Plan study activities that will build your faith in the Savior and use your time productively. - Plan your study around people, their needs, and preparing them for baptism, confirmation, and enduring to the end. Note your study plans in your daily planner. - Plan your study by asking: What will I be teaching today? How can I plan my study to best help those I teach? Which ideas and suggestions from this section will I incorporate in my study? As you plan your study activities, experiment with some of the ideas and suggestions that follow or with additional ideas you learn from others. ### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ### See the Big Picture (Page 37) - Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background. - Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph. - Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain. - Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 37) Read the chapter summaries of the books below and write an outline that describes the setting, main events, and main doctrines of each book. - 1 Nephi - Moses - Acts ### Explore the Details (Page 38) - Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions. Examine surrounding words or phrases for clues to what the key words mean. - Look for connecting words, such as therefore, and again, thus, wherefore, and others. Then see how the preceding and following passages relate to each other. - Use the Topical Guide to']","The chapter includes definitions and terms from the ”Ideas for Teaching“ section, key definitions in the lesson “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,” and suggestions for study, application, and memorization.

You can mark your scriptures in many ways. Find a method that works for you. Below are some guidelines for marking scriptures. - Use pencils or colored markers. Avoid using pens that bleed through the paper. - Shade, underline, bracket, or outline part of a verse, an entire verse, or a group of verses. - Avoid excessive marking. The benefit is lost if you cannot understand your markings because you have made too many notes, lines, and colors. - Underline only a few key words to highlight the verse, section, or chapter. - Circle or underline key words, and then use straight lines to link closely related words. - When a series of points in a verse or passage are related, number the points in the margin or text. - Use the footnotes as a resource for marking and interpreting the scriptures. - Place a symbol (such as a check mark) in the margin for key verses you feel are critical to remember. Marking your scriptures should help you focus on applying what you learn and on teaching others. Develop an approach that is consistent and helps you accomplish your purpose as a missionary. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 38) Which suggestions have you not yet tried? Identify one suggestion from “Study Ideas and Suggestions” to try during your next personal or companion study session. #### Remember This (Page 38) - Pursuing the desire to learn is important to your salvation and your success as a missionary. - You learn the gospel by study, faith, and the power of the Holy Ghost. - Learning is a joy and brings many blessings. - Daily personal and companion study strengthens your faith and your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Use a variety of study methods that make the experience meaningful and enjoyable. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 39) ### Personal Study (Page 39) 1. Rate yourself on the following (1=never, 3=some of the time, and 5=almost always). - I think about the people I am teaching when I study. - Throughout the day I think about what I studied in the morning. - As I study, ideas come to my mind that have not occurred to me before. - I record spiritual impressions and ideas in an appropriate place. - I fall asleep as I study. - I look forward to personal study. - I look forward to companion study. Review your responses. What are you doing well? Do you wish any of your responses were different? Set one or two goals that will improve the quality of your study. 2. Review the “Consider This” questions at the beginning of this chapter. How do these questions influence your study? 3. Review the “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Identify one suggestion from each category that you have not used, and try these ideas during your personal study. 4. Read Doctrine and Covenants 138:1–11. As you read these verses, answer the following questions: – What did President Smith have to do for his mind to be opened? – How did he feel about the doctrine he was thinking about? 5. Read the definition of knowledge in the Bible Dictionary and the references listed. In your study journal, write an answer to the question “What knowledge can help me serve effectively as a missionary?” 6. Select a doctrine from chapter 3 you would like to understand better. Write in your study journal questions you would like to answer. Carefully study that doctrine for a period of time (a few days), and pray specifically for increased understanding. Write what you learn. 7. Read 1 Nephi 10:17; 11:1–6. As you read these verses, answer the question “Why was Nephi able to learn what his father knew?” ### Companion Study (Page 39) 1. Read together the following passages. Answer the question “Why should we seek divine light?” - D&C 11:11–14, John 8:12, Psalm 119:105, and D&C 84:43–47. 2. Read together several of the passages below, and discuss blessings that come from studying the word of God. Which passages would best help those you teach? - 1 Nephi 10:19, 2 Nephi 32:3, Mosiah 1:6–7, Alma 17:2–3, Alma 32:42–43, Alma 37:44–46, Alma 49:30, D&C 90:24, D&C 130:19 and TG, “Scriptures, study of” and “Scriptures, value of,” 452–53 ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 40) 1. Select a topic from one of the missionary lessons that you have carefully studied. Do the following: – Share two or three main points you learned from your study that were helpful in teaching that lesson. – Describe the way you approached your study that helped you discover these points (how you read, resources you used, questions you were researching, and so on). – Show how you recorded and organized the results of your study. If time permits, ask a few other missionaries to do the same. 2. This activity may be done individually or in small groups. Instruct the missionaries to select one of the following questions (or you may create some of your own questions). Have them write the question down. – Why are families so important in God’s plan? – Why do people have trials and suffering? – What is the role of the Spirit in conversion? Explain that they will have five to seven minutes to: – Find at least two scripture references that answer the question. – Write a simple interpretation of how the scriptures they chose answer the question. – Describe what they would do to remember the answer. – Describe what they would do to explore the question more deeply. Invite a few missionaries (or each group) to share their answers. Discuss their responses. 3. Ask the missionaries to write one']","The context emphasizes the value of examining how the same word is used in various contexts or by different prophets to deepen understanding. It suggests that marking scriptures, such as in 1 Nephi 10:17 and 11:1–6, can help missionaries think deeply about passages and doctrines of the gospel. By studying these verses and noting their usage, missionaries can develop a better grasp of gospel principles, which is essential for effective teaching and spiritual growth during their service.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Who were the Nephites in the context of the Book of Mormon?,"['or two questions about the gospel principles and doctrines from one of the lessons in chapter 3 for which they would like to find an answer. Invite the missionaries to share their questions with the group. For each question, discuss the following: – How will answering this question bless the life of the missionary? – How will it bless the lives of investigators? – How could a missionary find the answer? 4. Ask several missionaries to share a gospel principle that their companions have taught them. Ask them to explain the principle and how their companion taught it to them. 5. Organize missionaries into companionships or small groups. Assign each group to read one chapter from the Book of Mormon. Have each group select one idea from each of the categories in the section “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Invite the groups to apply each suggestion as they read their chapter together. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for reading and discussion. Have each group explain the suggestions they used, how well the suggestions worked, and what they learned. 6. Invite each missionary to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to him or her (such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites). Invite the missionaries to sketch or describe how they visualize the accounts they have chosen. Invite two or three missionaries to share what they visualize. Ask others to tell the stories and relate them to doctrines in one of the lessons. Read Moroni 10:3 and discuss the value of pondering deeply about spiritual knowledge. ### Mission President (Page 41) 1. Invite missionaries to bring their study journals to interviews. Invite them to share one entry with you. 2. During interviews, ask some of the following questions: – What impressions have you had recently in your scripture study? – What is one gospel principle that your companion has recently taught you? – What chapter or section of this manual has helped you most in the past two weeks? – What are you doing in your personal study that helps you learn the most? 3. During zone conferences, invite missionaries to share meaningful experiences they have had in their personal and companion study. 4. During zone conferences, allow missionaries to share personal study ideas. 5. Share with missionaries insights you have had in your personal study. Share entries from your study journal and your testimony of the importance of gospel study. 6. As you can, join missionaries in their companion study. 7. During interviews, invite missionaries to share one of their lesson plans from one of the missionary lessons. Ask them what these doctrines mean to them. > Beginning of chapter 3 of the 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Do I Study and Teach? (Page 43) The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrines, principles, and commandments that you are to study, believe, love, live, and teach. They are what the living prophets and apostles have directed you to teach. They are organized so that you can help others clearly understand the doctrines of Christ. The lessons in this chapter are: 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 2. The Plan of Salvation 3. The Gospel of Jesus Christ 4. The Commandments 5. Laws and Ordinances Teach the first four lessons before baptism. Make sure those you teach qualify for baptism and confirmation by making and keeping all of the commitments in these lessons. Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching lessons before baptism with the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, new members are taught the first four lessons again, as well as “Laws and Ordinances.” Ward leaders determine whether ward missionaries or full-time missionaries lead out in ensuring that these lessons are taught and how long full-time missionaries are involved. Encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons. You should also use these lessons in individual and companion study, district meetings, and other training settings. As you study the scriptures and treasure up in your mind the doctrines in these lessons, the Spirit will give you in the very hour what you should say and do to help others receive a witness of the truthfulness of the teachings. As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and prepare to teach, keep firmly in mind these instructions. Make sure that you teach all the doctrines in these lessons. Unless directed by the Spirit, for each of the first three lessons, you should give the full content in the order in which they are written. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Each lesson outlines the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrines that you are to teach. Thoroughly learn the doctrines. Consistently focus on helping those you teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview']","The context provided does not include specific information about the Nephites, only mentioning them as a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to the individual, such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Who is Mosiah?,"['questions to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation. The lessons also have ideas for teaching. Use these suggestions to strengthen how you prepare and teach. ### The Role of Memorization (Page 44) Memorize scriptures to use in your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal points in each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language should focus their language study on preparing to teach the missionary lessons. They should memorize vocabu- lary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons. ### Teach with Clarity (Page 44) At the end of the first three lessons is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to make the message easy to understand. ### Scripture Study (Page 44) What are you directed to teach? Study Mosiah 18:18–20, D&C 43:15–16 and D&C 52:9 to find the answers to this question. Why must you study the doctrines in the lessons? Study Alma 17:2–3 and D&C 84:85 to find answers to this question. > Lesson One # 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 45) ## Your Purpose (Page 45) As you teach, prepare your investigators to meet the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the baptismal interview questions. This is best accomplished by inviting your investigators to make and keep the commitments listed below. ### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 45) - Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father? - Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world? - Do you believe that the Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith? - Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God? What does this mean to you? ### Commitments (Page 45) - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Other commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. > Lesson one: First Principle ## God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father (Page 45) God is our Heavenly Father. We are His children. He has a body of flesh and bone that is glorified and perfected. He loves us. He weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right. He wants to communicate with us, and we can communicate with Him through sincere prayer. He has given us this experience on the earth so we can learn and grow. We can show our love for Him through our choices and our obedience to His commandments. Heavenly Father has provided us, His children, with a way to be successful in this life and to return to live in His presence. However, we must be pure and clean through obedience in order to do so. Disobedience moves us away from Him. Central to our Father’s plan is Jesus Christ’s Atonement. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane as well as His suffering and death on the cross. Through the Atonement we can be freed from the burden of our sins and develop faith and strength to face our trials. ### Belief about God (Page 46) Determine what each person you are teaching understands regarding Christian beliefs about God. Many people in today’s world either have no concept of God or a very different perception of Deity. Two Book of Mormon missionaries, Ammon and Aaron, taught people who did not have a Christian background. They taught simple truths and invited their investigators to pray. Lamoni and his father were converted. Read Alma 18:24–40 and 22:4–23, and answer the questions below: - What did these missionaries teach about the nature of God? - How can you follow their examples? #### Scripture Study (Page 46) **What is the nature of God the Father and Jesus Christ?** Study the following scriptures to find answers to the question. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 Nephl 17:36 | 3 Nephl 27:13-22 | John 3:16-17 | | 2 Nephi 9:6 | D&C 38:1-3 | Acts 17:27-29 | | Mosiah 4:9 | D&C 130:22 | Romans 8:16 | | 3 Nephi 12:48 | Moses 1:39 | Hebrews 12:9 | | 3 Nephi 14:9-11 | Matthew 5:48 | 1 John 4:7-9 | > Lesson Two: Second Principle ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 46) The restored gospel blesses and helps husbands and wives, parents and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and spiritual strength in their families. These blessings are available now and in eternity. The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current concerns and challenges. Because families are ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in eternity. God has established families to bring happiness to His children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere, and prepare them for eternal life. The home is the best place to teach, learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing family members with peace, joy, and happiness. Through prophets in every age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for individuals and families. > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation (Page 46) One important way that God shows His love for us is by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the power and authority given']","The provided context does not include specific information about Mosiah, so I cannot provide an answer based solely on the given content.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
How does the Holy Ghost help prophets in their divine work?,"['to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation. They in turn teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer. The teachings of prophets are found in sacred books called scriptures. Our Father’s plan for us to be successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus’ Atonement at the center of that plan. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can receive eternal life if we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. “This is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:21). All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to accept or reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles. Those who choose to obey are blessed, but those who ignore, reject, or distort the gospel do not receive God’s promised blessings. Whenever people choose to disregard, disobey, or distort any gospel principle or ordinance, whenever they reject the Lord’s prophets, or whenever they fail to endure in faith, they distance themselves from God and begin to live in spiritual darkness. Eventually this leads to a condition called apostasy. When widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority to teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel. Biblical history has recorded many instances of God speaking to prophets, and it also tells of many instances of apostasy. To end each period of general apostasy, God has shown His love for His children by calling another prophet and giving him priesthood authority to restore and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ anew. In essence, the prophet acts as a steward to oversee the household of God here on earth. Such periods of time headed by prophetic responsibility are called dispensations. God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to Adam and gave him priesthood authority. Adam was the first prophet on the earth. By revelation, Adam learned of mankind’s proper relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Adam and Eve taught their children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel in all aspects of their lives. Adam was followed by other prophets, but over time the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel and fell into apostasy, choosing to be unrighteous. Thus began the pattern of prophetic dispensations that makes up much of the recorded history of the Old Testament. Heavenly Father revealed His gospel through direct communication to prophets such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Each prophet was called by God to begin a new dispensation of the gospel. To each of these prophets God granted priesthood authority and revealed eternal truths. Unfortunately, in each dispensation people eventually used their agency to choose to reject the gospel and then fell into apostasy. ### Prophets (Page 48) Determine what the person you are teaching understands about prophets. In most cultures there are people who believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God as defined in the restored gospel. Explain clearly that God establishes His kingdom on the earth by calling a prophet to establish a new dispensation. He gives that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. You might wonder how gospel dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people understand that God loves His children and that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. #### Scripture Study (Page 48) Study about Prophets using the following scriptures: - Jacob 4:4, 6, Mosiah 8:13–18, Acts 10:34–43, and Amos 3:7 Study about Dispensations using the following scriptures: - D&C 136:36–38, Moses 5:4–12, 55–59, Moses 8:19–30, Bible Dictionary, “Dispensations” > Lesson One: Fourth Principle ## The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement (Page 48) A few hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ, people again fell into apostasy. But when the Savior began His mortal ministry He established His Church again on the earth. Heavenly Father sent His Son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son . . . that the world through him might be saved” (John 3:16–17). Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take upon Him, by His suffering, the sins of all who would live on this earth and to overcome physical death. The Savior made an infinite atoning sacrifice so that if we have faith in Him, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end, we can receive forgiveness of our sins and enter and follow the path that will lead us to eternal life in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 31:13–21). During His earthly ministry, the Savior taught His gospel and performed many miracles. He called twelve men to be His Apostles and laid His hands on their heads to give them priest- hood authority. He organized His Church, fulfilled prophecy, and was rejected and crucified. Most important, He completed the Atonement. The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, completed all that His Heavenly Father sent Him to do. Before the Savior’s death and Resurrection, He gave His Apostles authority to teach His gospel, perform the ordinances of']","The context does not explicitly describe how the Holy Ghost helps prophets in their divine work, so I cannot provide an answer based solely on the provided information.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Why is understanding the history of the United States important for missionaries when teaching about the Great Apostasy and the Restoration of the gospel?,"['## The Great Apostasy (Page 49) After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept the doctrines of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the doctrines were corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost. Without revelation and priesthood authority, people relied on human wisdom to interpret the scriptures and the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. False ideas were taught as truth. Much of the knowledge of the true character and nature of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was lost. The doctrines of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or forgotten. The priesthood authority given to Christ’s Apostles was no longer present on the earth. This apostasy eventually led to the emergence of many churches. After centuries of spiritual darkness, truth-seeking men and women protested against current religious practices. They recognized that many of the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel had been changed or lost. They sought for greater spiritual light, and many spoke of the need for a restoration of truth. They did not claim, however, that God had called them to be a prophet. Instead, they tried to reform teachings and practices that they believed had been changed or corrupted. Their efforts led to the organization of many Protestant churches. This Reformation resulted in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the final Restoration. The Savior’s Apostles foretold this universal apostasy. They also foretold that the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church would be restored once more upon the earth. #### Scripture Study (Page 49) Study these scriptures to learn more anout the great apostacy: - 1 Nephi 13, 2 Nephi 26:20–21, 2 Nephi 28, 4 Nephi 1:27, D&C 86:1–3, Matthew 24:9–11, Mark 12:1–9, Acts 3:19–21 - Acts 20:28–30, Galatians 1:6–9, 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 (JST verses 2, 3, 7–9), 1 Timothy 4:1–3, 2 Timothy 4:3–4, 2 Peter 2:1–2, Amos 8:11–12 - Topical Guide: “Apostasy of the Early Christian Church”, True to the Faith, “Apostasy,” pages 13–14 Our Search for Happiness, pages 23–32 Jesus the Christ, chapter 40, “The Long Night of Apostasy” #### The Great Apostasy (Page 50) Investigators must understand that a universal apostasy occurred following the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. If there had been no apostasy, there would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As guided by the Spirit, teach investigators about the Great Apostasy at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. **Key Points** - The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see Ephesians 2:19–20; 4:11–14). These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer upon others the priesthood authority. - People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see Matthew 24:9; 1 Nephi 11:32–34; 2 Nephi 27:5). With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation ceased, and doctrine became corrupted. - Even before the death of the Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. The simple doctrines and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see Isaiah 24:5). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrines from them (1 Nephi 13:26–40). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see 3 John 1:9–10). People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see 2 Timothy 4:3–4). - Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshiped according to the light they possessed and have received answers to their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). - Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy. > Lesson One: Sixth Principle ## The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith (Page 50) When the circumstances were right, Heavenly Father once again reached out to His children in love. He called a young man named Joseph Smith as a prophet. Through him the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth. Joseph Smith lived in the United States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at the time. It was at a time of great religious excitement in the eastern United States. His family members were deeply religious and constantly sought for truth. But many ministers claimed to have the true gospel. Joseph desired “to know which of all the sects was right,” (Joseph Smith—History 1:18). The Bible taught there was “one Lord, one faith, one baptism”']","The context indicates that Joseph Smith lived in the United States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at the time. His family was deeply religious and sought for truth during a period of great religious excitement in the eastern United States. Understanding the history of the United States helps missionaries explain why Joseph Smith was able to receive divine revelations and restore the gospel, as the environment of religious freedom and the spiritual hunger of the people played a significant role in the Restoration process.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"As a Pastoral Mission Coordinator, how can I help others understand the significance of John the Baptist's role in restoring priesthood authority according to the context?","['(Ephesians 4:5). Joseph attended different churches, but he remained confused about which church he should join. He later wrote: *“So great were the confusions and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was . . . to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. . . . In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10).* As Joseph sought truth among the different faiths, he turned to the Bible for guidance. He read, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (James 1:5). Because of this passage, Joseph decided to ask God what he should do. In the spring of 1820 he went to a nearby grove of trees and knelt in prayer. He described his experience: *“I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. . . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17).* In this vision God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith. The Savior told Joseph not to join any of the churches, for they “were all wrong” and “all their creeds were an abomination.” He stated, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof” (Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Even though many good people believed in Christ and tried to understand and teach His gospel, they did not have the fulness of truth or the priesthood authority to baptize and perform other saving ordinances. They had inherited a state of apostasy as each generation was influenced by what the previous one passed on, including changes in the doctrines and in ordinances such as baptism. As God had done with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to the earth. After the appearance of the Father and the Son, other heavenly messengers, or angels were sent to Joseph Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery. John the Baptist appeared and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, which includes the authority to perform the ordinance of baptism. Peter, James, and John (three of Christ’s original Apostles) appeared and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, restoring the same authority given to Christ’s Apostles anciently. With this priesthood authority, Joseph Smith was directed to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth. Through him, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles. The time in which we live is referred to by Bible prophets as the last days, the latter days, or the dispensation of the fulness of times. It is the period of time just before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It is the final dispensation. This is why the Church is named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A living prophet directs the Church today. This prophet, the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is the authorized successor to Joseph Smith. He and the present Apostles trace their authority to Jesus Christ in an unbroken chain of ordinations through Joseph Smith. ### Memorize Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17 (Page 52) Memorize Joseph Smith’s description of seeing the Father and the Son (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17), and always be ready to describe the First Vision using his own words. Do not rush through it. Bear sincere testimony that you know it is true. Do not hesitate to explain how you came to know of its truth. Invite your companion to do so as well. ### Bear Testimony (Page 52) An important part of a missionary’s duty is to bear testimony of the current prophet and president of the Church. #### Scripture Study (page 52) Study 2 Nephi 3, D&C 112:30, Ephesians 1:10, Ephesians 4:5, James 1:5, and Brochure, The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith > Lesson One: Seventh Principle ## The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Page 52) Knowing that doubt, disbelief, and misinformation would remain after centuries of darkness, our loving Heavenly Father brought forth an ancient volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible, which contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. This volume of holy scripture provides convincing evidence that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God. This record is the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where gold plates had lain hidden for centuries. These gold plates contained the writings of prophets giving an account of God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Joseph Smith translated the contents of these plates by the power of God. The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of the Savior and taught His gospel. After His Resurrection, Christ appeared to these people. He taught them His gospel and established His Church. The Book of Mormon proves that “God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old” (D&C 20:11).

"How does the Book of Mormon serve as a means to confirm the truth of the Restoration, and what steps are recommended to sincerely seek this truth through prayer and scripture study?","['and pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64 > Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet.

God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 56) - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29). – God loves us and will help us make right choices. – Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17). - The Gospel Blesses Families – The gospel of Jesus Christ helps families develop stronger relationships. - Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see D&C 49:15–16). – The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see D&C 68:25; Genesis 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:7). – The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy. - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation – God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7). – Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel. – Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel.

How does Jeremiah contribute to our understanding of God's plan for His children and the importance of following His guidance?,"['greatest gifts to His children. Our eternal progression depends on how we use this gift. We must choose whether to follow Jesus Christ or follow Satan. We are physically separated from God during life on earth, but He wants every one of His children to find peace in this life and a fulness of joy in His presence after this life. He wants us to become like Him. #### Scripture Study (Page 63) - **Children of God** - D&C 93:29, Acts 17:29, Hebrews 12:9 - **Purpose** - Moses 1:39, and John 17:3 - **Premortal Life** - D&C 138:53–56, Moses 3:5, Abraham 3:22–26, Jeremiah 1:5, and Topical Guide, “Man, Antemortal Existence of” > Lesson Two: Second Principle ## The Creation (Page 63) Under the direction of the Father, Jesus Christ created the earth as a place for us to live and gain experience. In order to progress and become like God, each of us had to obtain a body and be tested during a time of probation on the earth. While on the earth we are out of God’s physical presence. We do not remember our pre-earth life. We must walk by faith rather than by sight. #### Scripture Study (Page 63) - 1 Nephi 17:36, Alma 30:44, D&C 88:41–47 - Moses 2:1, Moses 6:63, Abraham 3:24–25 - JST, John 1:1–3 2, Corinthians 5:6–7 > Lesson Two: Third Principle ## Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve (Page 63) Adam and Eve were the first of God’s children to come to the earth. God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were created in God’s image, with bodies of flesh and bones. While Adam and Eve were in the garden, they were still in God’s presence and could have lived forever. They lived in innocence, and God provided for their needs. In the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam and Eve their agency. He commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Obeying this commandment meant that they could remain in the garden, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality. They could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain. Satan tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and they chose to do so. This was part of God’s plan. Because of this choice, they were cast from the garden and out of God’s physical presence. This event is called the Fall. Separation from God’s presence is spiritual death. Adam and Eve became mortal—subject to physical death, or separation of the body and spirit. They could now experience disease and all types of suffering. They had moral agency or the ability to choose between good and evil. This made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin. In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God’s spirit children could come to earth, obtain physical bodies, and be tested. Only in this way could God’s children progress and become like Him. ### Teaching about the Fall (Page 64) When first teaching this doctrine, do not teach everything you know about it. Explain very simply that God chose two of His children, Adam and Eve, to become the first parents on earth. After their transgression they were subject to both sin and death. By themselves they could not return to live with Heavenly Father. The Lord spoke to Adam and taught him the plan of salvation and redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ. By following that plan, Adam and his family could have joy in this life and return to live with God (see Alma 18:36; 22:12–14). #### Scripture Study (Page 64) - In the Garden: 2 Nephi 2, Moses 2:26–31, Moses 3:15–17, Moses 5:11, Genesis 1:26–31, Genesis 2:15–17 - The Fall: 2 Nephi 2:25, Alma 12:22–34, Moses 4, Moses 5:10–12, Genesis 3 > Lesson Two: Fourth Principle ## Our Life on Earth (Page 64) Life on earth is an opportunity and a blessing. Our purpose in this life is to have joy and prepare to return to God’s presence. In mortality we live in a condition where we are subject to both physical and spiritual death. God has a perfect, glorified, immortal body of flesh and bones. To become like God and return to His presence, we too must have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones. However, because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, every person on earth has an imperfect, mortal body and will eventually die. If not for the Savior Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father. Along with physical death, sin is a major obstacle that keeps us from becoming like our Father in Heaven and returning to His presence. In our mortal condition we often yield to temptation, break God’s commandments, and sin. During our life on earth each of us makes mistakes. Although it sometimes appears otherwise, sin always leads to unhappiness. Sin causes feelings of guilt and shame. Because of our sins, we are unable to return to live with Heavenly Father unless we are first forgiven and cleansed. While we are in mortality, we have experiences that bring us happiness. We also have experiences that bring us pain and sorrow, some of which is caused by the sinful acts of others. These experiences provide us opportunities to learn and to grow, to distinguish good from evil, and to make choices. God influences us to do good; Satan tempts us to commit sin. As with physical death, we cannot overcome the effects of sin by ourselves. We are helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ. #### Scripture Study (Page 65) - Probation or Testing Period: 2 Nephi 2:21, 2 Nephi 9:27, Mosiah 3:19, Alma 12:21–24, Alma 34:31–35, Alma 42:2–10, Abraham 3:25–26 - Choice: 2 Nephi 2:26–29, Joshua 24:15, For the']","The provided context references Jeremiah 1:5, which highlights that God knew Jeremiah before he was formed in the womb and appointed him to be a prophet to the nations. This emphasizes that Jeremiah was chosen by God from the premortal existence to fulfill a specific purpose. The context also discusses the premortal life, where God's children, including Jeremiah, existed before coming to earth, and how they are known and called by Him. Jeremiah's role as a prophet aligns with the broader teachings about God's plan for His children, including the importance of following His guidance to progress and become like Him. His example underscores that God's children are known by Him from the beginning and are given opportunities to serve and fulfill their divine potential through obedience and faith.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"According to the context, who is Moroni and what role does he play in the teachings about good and evil?","['Strength of Youth, “Agency and Accountability” - Good and Evil: Moroni 7:12–19 - Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:8–10, 1 John 3:4 - The Unclean Cannot Be with God: 1 Nephi 10:20–21, Alma 41:10–11, 3 Nephi 27:19, Moses 6:57 > Lesson Two: Fifth Principle ## The Atonement (page 65) Before the world was organized, our Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ made it possible for us to overcome the effects of the Fall. All of the prophets since the world began have testified of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer. We will all suffer physical death, but Jesus Christ overcame the obstacle of physical death for us. When He died on the cross, His spirit became separated from His body. On the third day, His spirit and His body were reunited eternally, never to be separated again. He appeared to many people, showing them that He had an immortal body of flesh and bone. The reuniting of body and spirit is called resurrection and is a gift promised to each of us. Because of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, we will all be resurrected regardless of whether we have done good or evil in this life. We will have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones that will never again be subject to disease, pain, or death. The resurrection makes it possible to return to God’s presence to be judged but does not guarantee that we will be able to live in His presence. To receive that blessing, we must also be cleansed from sin. God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to overcome the obstacle of sin in addition to the obstacle of physical death. We are not responsible for the Fall of Adam and Eve, but we are responsible for our own sins. God cannot look on sin with any degree of allowance, and sin prevents us from living in His presence. Only through the Savior’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin so that we can live with God again. This is possible through exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. To fulfill the plan of salvation, Christ paid the penalty for our sins. He alone was able to do that. He was called and prepared in pre-earth life. He was the literal Son of God in the flesh. He was sinless and completely obedient to His Father. Though tempted, He never gave in to temptation. When the Father asked His Beloved Son to pay the price of the world’s sins, Jesus was prepared and willing. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and His suffering and death on the cross, and it ended with His Resurrection. Though He suffered beyond comprehension—so much so that He bled from every pore and asked whether it were possible that this burden be lifted from Him—He submitted to the Father’s will in a supreme expression of love for His Father and for us. This triumph of Jesus Christ over spiritual death by His suffering and over physical death by His Resurrection is called the Atonement. Christ promises to forgive our sins on the condition that we accept Him by exercising faith in Him, repenting, receiving baptism by immersion, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and striving faithfully to keep His commandments to the end of our lives. Through continuing repentance, we may obtain forgiveness and be cleansed of our sins by the power of the Holy Ghost. We are relieved of the burden of guilt and shame, and through Jesus Christ we become worthy to return to the presence of God. As we rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In paying the penalty for our sins, Jesus did not, however, eliminate our personal responsibility. We must show that we accept Him and that we will follow His command- ments. Only through the gift of the Atonement can we return to live with God. #### Scripture Study (Page 66) - Resurrection: 2 Nephi 9:6–7, Alma 11:42–45, Alma 40:23, Helaman 14:15–19, D&C 88:27–32 Luke 24:1–10, 36–39, 1 Corinthians 15:20–23, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40, Topical Guide, “Resurrection”, Bible Dictionary - “Death,” “Resurrection” - Atonement: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, Alma 7:11–13, Alma 34:8–10, D&C 19:15–19, D&C 45:3–5, John 3:16–17, 1 John 1:7, Bible Dictionary, “Atonement” - The Gospel—The Way: 2 Nephi 9:1–24, 2 Nephi 31, Alma 11:40, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27, Moroni 7:27–28 > Lesson Two: Sixth Principle ## The Spirit World (page 66) Even though Christ conquered physical death, all people must die, for death is part of the process by which we are transformed from mortality to immortality.

Through the resurrection all people will become immortal—they will live forever. Immortality is a free gift to all people, whether they are righteous or wicked. Eternal life is not, however, the same as immortality. Eternal life is a gift of God given only to those who obey His gospel. It is the highest state that we can achieve. It comes to those who are freed from sin and suffering through the Atonement of Christ. It is exaltation, which means living with God forever in eternal families. It is to know God and Jesus Christ and to experience the life they enjoy. ### Resurrection and Reincarnation (Page 67) Some people may confuse the doctrine of resurrection with the concept of reincarnation. The concept of reincarnation involves being born into the world again in a different form and is false doctrine. The doctrine of resurrection involves receiving an eternal reward of an immortal body of flesh and bone. This is true doctrine. Make sure those you teach understand clearly the doctrine of the resurrection. > Lesson Two: Eighth Principle ## Kingdoms of Glory (Page 67) During our mortal lives we make choices regarding good and evil. God rewards us according to our works and desires. Because God rewards everyone according to deeds done in the body, there are different kingdoms of glory to which we may be assigned after the Judgment. Those who have repented of their sins and received the ordinances of the gospel and kept the associated covenants will be cleansed by the Atonement of Christ. They will receive exaltation in the highest kingdom, also known as the celestial kingdom. They will live in God’s presence, become like Him, and receive a fulness of joy. They will live together for eternity with those of their family who qualify. In the scriptures this kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun. People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars. #### Scripture Study (Page 68) - Resurrection and Restoration: 2 Nephi 9:14–15, Jacob 6:8–9,Alma 42:13–15, 22–23 - Judgment: 2 Nephi 28:23, Mosiah 3:23–25, Alma 5:15–21, Alma 12:12–14, D&C 132:12; 137:9 John 5:22 - Kingdoms of Glory: 3 Nephi 28:10, D&C 76: Introduction, D&C 76, D&C 137, Matthew 5:48, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40 - Eternal Life: 2 Nephi 31:17–21, D&C 14:7, D&C 29:43–44, D&C 45:8, D&C 93:19, John 3:16, John 17:3 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 68) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

What does the plan of salvation teach us about the Spirit World?,"['### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 69) The plan of salvation teaches us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. It maps our eternal journey through premortality, mortal life, death, resurrection, and to our life in the eternities. The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him. The plan focuses on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ in overcoming the effects of the Fall and making eternal life possible for us.

It gives us hope and helps us find peace, joy, and happiness. It tells us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. God is our Father, and He loves us. We are His children. We are part of His family, and we lived with Him before we were born on this earth. He has a plan of happiness that makes it possible for us to return to His presence after this life. Our progress depends on how we use our God-given agency, or ability to choose. As part of that plan, the Fall of Adam made it possible for us to come to earth, gain a physical body, have experience, and have families of our own. But the Fall also brought physical death, which is separation of the spirit from the body, and spiritual death, which is separation from God. Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan. Christ’s atoning sacrifice overcame the effects of both physical and spiritual death. We will all be resurrected and will live forever with physical bodies free of pain and sickness. Christ also made it possible to overcome spiritual death. As we live His gospel He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. As part of God’s merciful plan, we will all suffer a physical death. Our spirits will be separated from our bodies and will live for a time in the spirit world. We will then be resurrected with an immortal body, an eternal union of our body and spirit. We will be judged according to our works and desires. Those who have lived the gospel will receive our Father in Heaven’s greatest gift, the gift of eternal life in His presence. Our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love to reveal His plan of happiness. We learn about this wonderful plan in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about.

This is called the Fall. – They became mortal, were able to have children, and were also subject to sin and death (see 2 Nephi 2:22–25; Moses 5:11). - Our Life on Earth – Our purpose in life is to find lasting peace, joy, and happiness as families and to prepare to return to live with God. – We came to the earth to be tested (see Abraham 3:24–25). – We gain a body of flesh and bones, but we are subject to physical death. – God gives commandments. If we obey, we are blessed. If we disobey, we sin and receive the consequences. – All sin must be paid for, either by ourselves or by Christ (see D&C 19:15–20). – We make choices, and we all commit sin (see Romans 3:23). – We have experiences that bring us happiness and also sorrow. – We cannot overcome either physical or spiritual death without Christ. - The Atonement – Because Jesus Christ overcame physical death, we will all be resurrected (see Alma 11:41–43). – Through Christ’s Atonement we can become clean from sin so that we can return to live in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 9:8–9). – Christ will forgive our sins as we have faith in Him, repent, receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. - The Spirit World – All people must die. – At death our spirits go to the spirit world. – We live in either a state of misery or a state of peace and rest, depending on how we lived in this life. - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality – Our spirits and bodies will be reunited in the resurrection (see Alma 11:42–45; 40:23). – We will return to God’s presence to be judged according to our works and desires. – If we have repented, we will receive mercy. – Eternal life is a gift of God given to those who fully obey the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 14:7). - Kingdoms of Glory (see D&C 76; 137; 1 Corinthians 15:40–42). – We receive rewards according to our works and desires (see D&C 137:9). – Those who receive the gospel and live it valiantly throughout their lives will receive the celestial kingdom (see D&C 76:50–70). – Honorable people who are “blinded by the craftiness of men” and who are “not valiant in the testimony of Jesus [Christ]” receive the terrestrial kingdom (see D&C 76:75, 79). – Those who sin and do not repent will receive the telestial glory after they suffer and pay for their sins. **Commitments** - Will you pray to know that what we have taught is true? - Will you repent of your sins? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","The context mentions that God's plan of happiness makes it possible to return to His presence and that Jesus Christ is central to that plan.

What does 2 Nephi teach about the role of Christ’s Atonement in our judgment and mercy?,"['Nephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over.

Who was Joseph Smith and how is he related to the principles of repentance and baptism?,"['from our sins and do them no more. We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper. Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son. Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions. In addition, we should continually improve—to develop Christlike qualities, to grow in knowledge, and to serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior expects of us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily. #### Scripture Study (Page 77) - We All Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:7–8 - Repentance: Alma 34:8–17, D&C 58:42–43, D&C 61:2, 2 Corinthians 7:9–10, Bible Dictionary, “Repentance” - Redemption and Forgiveness: Helaman 5:10–11 - Mercy Claims the Penitent: Alma 12:32–35, Alma 42:13, 21–24, D&C 18:10–13 > Lesson Three: Fourth Principle ## Baptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. #### Before Baptism (Page 78) “Ensure that [investigators] have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. Investigators should live the principles of moral worthiness, the Word of Wisdom, and commit to pay tithing. If missionaries feel additional preparation is needed, they should postpone baptism until the investigator meets the standard. *“Before baptism each investigator should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch president, and attend several sacrament meetings”* (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). #### Scripture Study (Page 79) - Christ’s Example: 2 Nephi 31:4–18, Matthew 3:13–17 - The Baptismal Covenant: Mosiah 5:8–10, Mosiah 18:8–10, D&C 20:37 - Qualifications']","The provided context does not contain information about Joseph Smith or his relation to the principles of repentance and baptism.

Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson.

By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes.

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

We do not act as equals in the agreement. God gives the conditions for the covenant, and we agree to do what He asks us to do. God then promises us certain blessings for our obedience. We receive ordinances by covenant. When we make such covenants, we promise to honor them. For example, members of the Church covenant with the Lord at baptism and renew those covenants by partaking of the sacrament. We make further covenants in the temple. The Lord’s people are a covenant people. We are greatly blessed as we keep our covenants with the Lord. - **Endure to the End:** To remain true to the commandments of God despite temptation, opposition, and adversity throughout life. - **Eternal Life:** To live forever as families in God’s presence (see D&C 132:19–20). Eternal life is God's greatest gift to man. - **Gospel:** God’s plan of salvation, made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The gospel includes the eternal truths or laws, covenants, and ordinances needed for mankind to return to the presence of God. - **Grace:** The enabling power from Jesus Christ that allows us to obtain blessings in this life and to gain eternal life and exaltation after we have exercised faith, repented, and given our best effort to keep the commandments. Such divine help or strength is given through the mercy and love of Jesus Christ. We all need divine grace because of Adam’s Fall and also because of our weaknesses. - **Mercy:** The spirit of compassion, tenderness, and forgiveness. Mercy is one of the attributes of God. Jesus Christ offers mercy to us through His atoning sacrifice on conditions of repentance. - **Restitution:** The return of something that has been taken away or lost. For example, the Restoration of the goepel is called a restitution (see Acts 3:19–21). The word restoration also refers to the restoration of the body (see Alma 41:10–15). ### Other Terms That May Need Further Definition for Those You Teach (Page 84) - Clean from sin - Prayer - Temptation - Confession - Sacrament - Forgiveness - Strait and narrow path > Lesson Four # The Commandments: Preparing for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 85) There are many ways to teach the commandments found in this lesson. For example, you might teach a few of the commandments from this lesson as part of the first three lessons, or you might teach several commandments as a single lesson. What you do should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. ## Prepare to Teach (Page 85) Your purpose in teaching the commandments is to help people live the gospel by exercising faith in Jesus Christ and repenting as they prepare for baptism and confirmation. By obeying the commandments, people will grow in their testimony of the gospel, show that they have “broken hearts and contrite spirits,” and begin to repent of all their sins (see Moroni 6:1–4; D&C 20:37). This lesson is organized differently from the first three. The first three lessons explain the doctrinal foundation for the gospel of Jesus Christ. This lesson explains specific commandments God has given that help us apply gospel principles in our lives. There are many ways to teach this lesson. The approach you take should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. Constantly think and pray about how to help investigators live the gospel. Ideas include: - Teaching one or more commandments as part of the first three lessons. When doing so, consider the principle taught in Alma 12:32: “God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption” (italics added). Certain commandments, such as prayer and scripture study, might be taught best as part of the first three lessons. Other commandments might be best taught after you have laid the doctrinal foundation of the gospel found in the first three lessons. - Teaching two or three of the commandments as a single lesson. - Teaching a single commandment as a lesson. - Teaching the commandments in the context of the gospel. Briefly review the lesson on the gospel of Jesus Christ before teaching one or more of the commandments. As you do so, you can help investigators see how the commandments fit into the larger picture of exercising faith in the Savior and repenting in preparation for baptism and confirmation. Their lives can be blessed as they see the gospel of Jesus Christ as a pattern for living. You may be able to teach some investigators in a few visits; others may require more visits. You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.

What does D&C say about the importance of keeping the Sabbath day holy?,"['from our labors. As we attend Church services and worship together, we strengthen each other. We are renewed by our association with friends and family. Our faith is strengthened as we study the scriptures and learn more about the restored gospel. When a community or nation grows careless in its Sabbath activities, its religious life decays and all aspects of life are negatively affected. The blessings associated with keeping the Sabbath day holy are lost. We should refrain from shopping on the Sabbath and participating in other commercial and sporting activities that now commonly desecrate the Sabbath. Latter-day Saints should set this holy day apart from activities of the world by entering into a spirit of worship, thanksgiving, service, and family-centered activities appropriate to the Sabbath. As Church members endeavor to make their Sabbath activities compatible with the intent and Spirit of the Lord, their lives will be filled with joy and peace. #### Scripture Study (Page 88) - 3 Nephi 18:1–25, D&C 59:9–15, Exodus 20:8–11, Exodus 31:12–17, Isaiah 58:13–14 #### Sit with Investigators or Members at Church (Page 88) When attending sacrament meetings or stake conferences, missionary companionships should sit with investigators, recent converts, or members. They should not sit with other missionaries. - Will you keep the Sabbath day holy? - Will you prepare yourself to partake of the sacrament worthily? **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - What do you understand of the Sabbath day, including partaking of the sacrament weekly and rendering service to others? Are you willing to obey this law [before your baptism]? ## Baptism and Confirmation (Page 89) The way we show our desire to follow in God’s way is through baptism and confirmation. When we are baptized and confirmed, we enter into a covenant that we will take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and that we will always remember Him and keep His commandments. We also promise to stand as witnesses of God at all times and to assist those in need (see Mosiah 18:8–9). In return, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. #### Commitments (Page 89) - Will you be baptized and confirmed? - Will you invite your friends and family to attend a baptismal service? If possible, invite investigators to attend a baptismal service and a sacrament meeting during which someone is confirmed. **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - All baptismal interview questions. - Invitation to Be Baptize: The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Follow the Prophet (Page 89) Truth is a knowledge of things as they really are, were, and will be. It does not change with conditions or time. Truth is the same in every age and culture. God is the source of all truth. We can have faith in Him because we know He will teach us only truth. God wants all His children to know the truth. Therefore, He reveals the truths necessary for salvation through prophets and apostles. He reveals truth to us personally through the scriptures and personal revelation. A prophet is called and chosen by God and is a righteous man with great faith. The Lord reveals truth to him through the Holy Ghost. He commands His prophet to teach truth to all people. Those who believe God’s words as revealed through His prophet are blessed. Christ’s Church is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets, who direct the Church by revelation. The Lord called Joseph Smith as the first prophet and head of this last dispensation. His successors who lead The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today are also prophets and apostles. The President of the Church today is a living prophet. We are to have faith in God’s chosen prophet, gain conviction of his divine calling, and follow his teachings. We have frequent opportunities to sustain Church leaders publicly. Sustain means to support. We are to prepare ourselves so that when the prophets and apostles speak, the Holy Ghost can confirm the truths they teach, and we can then determine to follow the counsel they give us. Those who listen to and follow the counsel of living prophets and apostles will not go astray. The teachings of living prophets provide an anchor of eternal truth in a world of shifting values and help us avoid misery and sorrow. The confusion and strife of the world will not overwhelm us, and we can enjoy the assurance of being in harmony with God’s will. #### Scripture Study (Page 90) | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Mosiah 15:11-12 | D&C 21:1-7 | Ephesians 2:19-20 | | Alma 13:1-16 | D&C 136:37-38 | Ephesians 4:11-14 | | 3 Nephi 12:1-2 | John 15:16 | Hebrews 5:4 | | D&C 1:37-38 | Acts 10:34-44 | Amos 3:7 | **Commitments** - Will you meet the bishop? - Will you sustain and follow the counsel of Church leaders? **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God? What does that mean to you? ## Keep the Ten Commandments (Page 90) Heavenly Father gives us commandments so that we will know what to do and what to avoid in order to receive the blessings He wants to give us (joy, peace of conscience, lasting happiness). God revealed to Moses the Ten Commandments to guide His people: - “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3). Other “gods” can include possessions, power, or prominence. - “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” (Exodus 20:4). - “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” (Exodus 20:7). - “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus']","The context emphasizes that when a community or nation grows careless in its Sabbath activities, its religious life decays and all aspects of life are negatively affected.

Latter-day Saints are encouraged to refrain from shopping and participating in commercial and sporting activities that desecrate the Sabbath, and instead enter into a spirit of worship, thanksgiving, service, and family-centered activities. Keeping the Sabbath holy fills lives with joy and peace, and is supported by scriptures such as D&C 59:9–15, which highlight the importance of observing this day.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
How does Christ's role relate to salvation for those who did not have the opportunity to receive the gospel during their mortal lives?,"['makes salvation possible for everyone who did not have the opportunity to receive, understand, and obey the gospel during their mortal lives. The gospel is preached to these deceased people in the spirit world. Members of the Church on earth perform the saving ordinances in behalf of their deceased ancestors and others. Deceased persons living in the spirit world have the opportunity to accept or reject the gospel and the ordinances performed in their behalf. For this reason, Church members search for information about their ancestors. They complete pedigree charts and family group records and submit the names of deceased relatives who need to have saving ordinances performed on their behalf in sacred temples. This is family history work. Worthy members ages 12 and over, including new members, may receive from their bishop a recommend to perform baptisms for the dead. #### Family History (Page 100) Invite new members to meet with a member or go to a local family history center (where available) for an introduction to family history work and to the resources available to them. Provide them with a copy of family history materials. #### Scripture Study (Page 100) - D&C 43:16, D&C 128, D&C 138, 1 Peter 3:18-21 - D&C 95:8-9, D&C 131, Psalm 65:4, 1 Corinthians 15:29 - D&C 124:22-42, D&C 132, Brochure, Welcome to the Family History Center #### Commitments (Page 100) - Will you prepare to receive temple ordinances? (Soon after baptism and confirmation, worthy members over age 12 can receive a recommend to go to the temple and participate in baptisms for the dead.) - Will you participate in family history work and submit the names of ancestors to receive proxy temple ordinances? ### Service (Page 101) One of the great blessings of membership in the Church is the opportunity to serve. When we give loving service to others, we are serving God. When we are baptized, we covenant to give such service (see Mosiah 18:8–10). We are to become aware of others’ physical and spiritual needs. We then give of our time, talents, and means to help meet those needs. We follow the example of the Savior, who came to serve others. We are to do what Jesus did and become like Him. Soon after baptism new members receive from priesthood leaders the blessing of a responsibility to help in the Church. This is referred to as a calling. All of the work in the Church is voluntary. No one is paid for such service. When we accept callings, we are sustained publicly in a Church meeting so that other members can acknowledge our calling and provide support. We are also set apart by a priesthood leader and given special blessings to help us fulfill our callings. The Church needs the talents and abilities of every member to fill a wide variety of callings. All callings are important and help build God’s kingdom. We are to accept such callings and work diligently to learn and fulfill our duties. As we do so, we grow in faith, develop new talents and a greater ability to serve, and receive numerous other blessings. Priesthood holders may be called as home teachers. Home teachers make at least monthly visits to the homes of assigned member families. They teach the gospel, support parents, nurture friendships, and help families prepare to receive and keep temple covenants. Visiting teachers represent the Relief Society by making monthly visits to each adult sister as assigned. #### Scripture Study (Page 101) **Charity:** - Moroni 7:43-48, D&C 88:125, Matthew 22:36-40, 1 Corinthians 13:1-8 **Care for the Poor:** - Mosiah 4:26, Alma 34:28-29, D&C 52:40, Matthew 25:40 **We Are to Serve:** - Mosiah 2:17, Mosiah 18:8-10, D&C 42:29, D&C 107:99-100 #### Commitments (Page 101) - Will you accept and fulfill the duties of a calling (including an assignment as a home teacher or visiting teacher)? - Will you support others in their callings? ### Teaching and Learning in the Church (Page 102) The Church is organized to perfect and bless the lives of the members. It gives us opportunities to teach one another the gospel, fellowship and serve one another, and support one another in our quest for salvation. In the family and through the Church, each member is taught the doctrines of the gospel. When members are called to teaching assignments, they are provided materials and help to enable them to succeed. #### Scripture Study (Page 102) - D&C 88:77–79, Ephesians 4:11–14 #### Commitment (Page 102) - Will you attend church? ### Endure to the End (Page 102) As we continue to live the gospel, we grow closer to our Heavenly Father. We enjoy and appreciate more the Atonement of the Savior. Our families are drawn closer together. We experience greater feelings of the love, joy, and peace that come from the Atonement. Our hearts are changed, and we find security in living the restored gospel. As we continue to exercise faith in Christ, repent, and renew our covenants, we enjoy continued guidance from the Holy Ghost. If we endure to the end of our lives in being true to our covenants, we will receive eternal life. A few members do not endure or remain fully active. However, enduring to the end is a personal responsibility. We “work out [our] own salvation” (Philippians 2:12), and we serve and love those whose faith has grown weak through inactivity. #### Scripture Study (Page 102) - 2 Nephi 31:20–21, Moroni 6:4, D&C 20:37, Articles of Faith 1:3 - John 14:15, 21, Ephesians 4:11–14, Philippians 2:12 #### Commitment (Page 102) - Will you continue to live the gospel by keeping baptismal covenants throughout your life? > Beginning of Chapter 4 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?

How does 1 Nephi 10:22 relate to receiving the Holy Ghost in missionary work?,"['the Spirit in missionary work? - How can I recognize the promptings of the Spirit? ## Personal Revelation (Page 103) Joseph Smith said, “Salvation cannot come without revelation; it is in vain for anyone to minister without it” (History of the Church, 3:389). You will succeed in your work as you learn to receive and follow personal revelation. Joseph Smith also taught that revelation is vital for your daily work: “This is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed” (History of the Church, 5:135). God loves you and all His children. He is anxious to support you in your practical and specific challenges. You have been promised inspiration to know what to do and have been given the power to do it (see D&C 43:15–16). He will help you as you try to recognize and understand the Spirit through diligent scripture study. He will guide you to people who will receive the message of the Restoration. He will give you power to deliver the message and to testify of Christ and His gospel. He will shower His blessings upon you through the gift of the Holy Ghost. He asks that you remain worthy of this gift and that you ask, seek, and knock (see D&C 4:7; Matthew 7:7–8). We live in the day prophesied by Book of Mormon prophets—a day when people will “contend one with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance” (2 Nephi 28:4; see also 3 Nephi 29:6; Mormon 9:7–8). Yet many people also yearn for spiritual things. As you learn to receive personal revelation, you will teach with power and authority (see Alma 17:3) because the Holy Ghost gives you power to speak (see 1 Nephi 10:22). You need to seek and receive personal revelation through the Holy Ghost as you help people become baptized and confirmed. Have faith that you will receive personal revelation to guide you from day to day. The Holy Ghost will help you in every aspect of your work. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 104) In Moroni’s concluding testimony, he wrote “a few words by way of exhortation” (Moroni 10:2). Read Moroni 10 and write in your own words what Moroni exhorts the reader of the Book of Mormon to do. (Exhort means to encourage strongly or urge someone to do something.) ## The Light of Christ (Page 104) A person is capable of receiving spiritual guidance before being baptized and confirmed. This spiritual influence begins with the Light of Christ, which “is given to every man, that he may know good from evil” (Moroni 7:16; see also verses 14–19). “The light of Christ is just what the words imply: enlightenment, knowledge, and an uplifting, ennobling, persevering influence that comes upon mankind because of Jesus Christ. . . . “The light of Christ should not be confused with the personage of the Holy Ghost, for the light of Christ is not a personage at all. Its influence is preliminary to and preparatory to one’s receiving the Holy Ghost. The light of Christ will lead the honest soul who ‘hearkeneth to the voice’ to find the true gospel and the true Church and thereby receive the Holy Ghost” (Bible Dictionary, “Light of Christ,” 725; see also D&C 84:46–47). President Boyd K. Packer said, “It is important for a . . . missionary . . . to know that the Holy Ghost can work through the Light of Christ. A teacher of gospel truths is not planting something foreign or even new into an adult or a child. Rather, the missionary or teacher is making contact with the Spirit of Christ already there. The gospel will have a familiar ‘ring’ to them” (“The Light of Christ,” address delivered at the seminar for new mission presidents, 22 June 2004, 2). ## The Holy Ghost (Page 104) - **The personage of the Holy Ghost.** The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. He is a personage of spirit and does not have a body of flesh and bones (see D&C 130:22). He is the Comforter, who the Savior promised would teach His followers all things and bring to their remembrance all things that He had taught them (see John 14:26). - **The power of the Holy Ghost.** The witness that comes to sincere investigators before baptism comes through the power of the Holy Ghost. “The power [of the Holy Ghost] can come upon one before baptism, and is the convincing witness that the gospel is true. It gives one a testimony of Jesus Christ and of his work and the work of his servants upon the earth” (Bible Dictionary, “Holy Ghost,” 704). The Holy Ghost testifies of truth. All people can know the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon through the power of the Holy Ghost. “By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things” (Moroni 10:5). - **The gift of the Holy Ghost.** Investigators who receive a witness do not yet have the promise of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Smith said: “There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him” (History of the Church, 4:555). “The gift [of the Holy Ghost] can come only after proper and authorized baptism, and is conferred by the laying on of hands. . . . The gift of the Holy Ghost is the right to have, whenever one is worthy, the companionship of the Holy Ghost” (Bible Dictionary, “Holy']","In 1 Nephi 10:22, it is stated that the Holy Ghost gives power to speak, which is essential for missionary work. The context emphasizes that learning to receive and follow personal revelation through the Holy Ghost is vital for success. The Holy Ghost helps missionaries recognize and understand spiritual promptings, guides them to those receptive to the message, and empowers them to testify of Christ and His gospel. The passage highlights that the Holy Ghost's influence is a key part of teaching with power and authority, and that receiving personal revelation is necessary for effective missionary service.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"What do D&C 132:7, 18–19, 26 teach about the sealing and covenants?","['Ghost,” 704). As a member of the Church, you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost by priesthood authority. This gift entitles you to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as you remain worthy of it. Pray for the Spirit’s guidance, and valiantly follow the promptings you receive. “The gift of the Holy Ghost comes after one repents and becomes worthy. . . . The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ so deeply that no earthly power or authority can separate him from that knowledge."" – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST—A SURE COMPASS,” ENSIGN, APR. 1996, 4 - **The Holy Spirit of Promise.** The Holy Ghost is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise (see D&C 88:3). To be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable to God. The Holy Spirit of Promise testifies to the Father that the saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants associated with them have been kept. Those who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has (see D&C 76:51–60; Ephesians 1:13–14). All covenants and performances must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise if they are to be valid after this life (see D&C 132:7, 18–19, 26). Breaking covenants may remove the sealing. - **Gifts of the Spirit.** The gifts of the Spirit are special spiritual blessings that the Lord gives to worthy individuals for their own benefit and for their use in blessing others. For example, missionaries who must learn a new language may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help in learning a language. Several gifts of the Spirit are described in Moroni 10:8–18; Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33; and 1 Corinthians 12:1–12. These are only some examples of the many gifts of the Spirit. The Lord may bless you in other ways depending on your faithfulness, your needs, and the needs of those you serve. You should desire spiritual gifts and earnestly seek for them (see D&C 46:8; 1 Corinthians 12:31; 14:1, 12). These gifts come by prayer, faith, and works, according to God’s will (see D&C 63:9–12; 84:64–73). #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 106) Read the references below: - Bible Dictionary, “Holy Ghost,” “Light of Christ,” and “Spirit.” - Our Search for Happiness, 84–86, 91–92. - True to the Faith, “Holy Ghost,” 81–84, and “Spiritual Gifts,” 165–67. Write a description of the nature and role of the Holy Ghost. - Read Acts 4:23–33. - How did Peter and John seek spiritual gifts? - How did the Lord answer their prayers? - What can you learn from this experience about your own work? ## The Power of the Spirit in Conversion (Page 106) The power of the Holy Ghost is central to conversion. Strive to understand the doctrine of conversion and also the experience of conversion. President Boyd K. Packer explained the central role of the Spirit in conversion: “When conversion takes place, it is through the power of the Spirit. In order to succeed in missionary work, these three things must occur: “We must understand what an investigator must feel in order to receive conversion. “We must understand how a missionary must feel in order to teach with the converting power of the Spirit. “And then we must understand how a member must feel to succeed in participating in the conversion experience” (mission presidents’ conference, 3 Apr. 1985). The better you understand how investigators, missionaries, and members feel when they receive the witness of the Spirit, the better you will understand your own role, which is to: - Be edified and have your mind enlightened as you search the scriptures and teach the doctrine. - Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear witness. You do this by teaching and testifying of the message of the Restoration. Teach as directed by the Spirit, and testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true. - Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting the message to each person’s needs. - Invite people to act. Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and make and keep covenants. Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke of the power of the Spirit: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed. When individuals . . . feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word. This is how we come to feel the gospel is true” (“Now Is the Time,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 75). The Holy Ghost works in the hearts of people to bring about these changes. As people choose to keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly and will develop the faith to obey Christ. Thus, you should help the people you work with grow in faith by inviting them to repent and to make and keep commitments. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 107) - Read one or two of the following passages, and ponder what an investigator must feel to be converted. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and members: 2 Nephi 4:16–35; Enos 1; Mosiah 4–5; 18:7–14; 27–28; Alma 5; 17–22; 32; 36; 38 - Read one or two of the following passages and ponder what you as a missionary and as a member must feel to teach with converting power.

"How do the family communication methods support cost-effective communication, and how can missionaries ensure they stay within their budget while maintaining effective contact with their families?","['<1-hop>\n\nFamily You may communicate with your family on your weekly preparation day via letters, emails, text messages, online messaging, phone calls, and video chat. Use the approved communication method that works best for you and your family and that is cost-effective so that you can stay within your monthly budget. This will vary depending on circumstances, location, and schedule. If your parents live in different locations, you may contact each parent separately on preparation day. You also are encouraged to contact your family on other special occasions, such as Christmas, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, your parents’ birthdays, and other holidays that are significant in your home country or culture. You should initiate all text message conversations, online messaging, phone calls, and video chats. If your family needs to contact you, they should contact the mission president first. When communicating with your family by phone or video chat, be wise in determining the duration of your calls. In making these decisions, be considerate of your companion and keep in mind the purpose of your missionary service. > 3.9.2 ### Mission President Write a letter to your mission president weekly on preparation day. Generally, you will submit your letter to him using the Missionary Portal. Only your mission president will review your weekly letter. Be open and honest so that he can understand any concerns you have and provide relevant counsel and feedback. Please be aware that he will read but not be able to respond to every letter. If you receive important news from home that needs immediate attention, inform your mission president and check with him before contacting your family on days other than preparation day or on special occasions. > 3.9.3 ### Communicating with People in Your Mission As you contact people from other areas in your mission, be sure that your communication is focused on fulfilling your missionary purpose. Follow the standards in section 3.5.1, “General Standards for Interacting with Adults,” and in Safeguards for Using Technology, and remember to include your companion as you participate in these communications. > 3.9.4 ### Packages and Letters Some missions may use the mission office address to receive mail and packages and as your return address. This practice can protect your safety and help prevent mail theft and lost mail due to transfers. Please follow all guidelines you receive in such cases. > 3.9.5 ### Missionary Experiences with People from Home You may know a person at home whose personal experience could help someone you are teaching in your mission. You should ask your mission president for permission for that person to share her or his experience and testimony. Counsel with the person about the best communication technology to use. If your family or friends from home want to learn more about the gospel of Jesus Christ, your mission president may allow you to teach them using technology (see 7.5.4). > 3.9.6 ### Personal Visits from Family and Friends Generally, family and friends should not visit you during your mission. However, under special circumstances, your mission president may approve an exception. These visits should be short and not interfere with your missionary duties. A visit should not inconvenience your companion, other missionaries, or the people you teach. Take care that any such visit does not pull your thoughts away from your service or create a financial problem for your family. > 3.9.7 ### Emergencies If your family tells you of an emergency at home, let your mission leaders know so they can give you support.

"How do safety protocols and danger prevention relate to reporting and handling dangerous or uncomftrable situtations during missionary work, and why is immediate reporting important if a problem occurs?","['<1-hop>\n\nPhysical Well-Being > 4.0 ## Introduction Missionary work requires physical and emotional commitment. The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe. If there', '<2-hop>\n\nis a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders. Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately. For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders.

They include staying aware of surroundings, following mission standards, and avoiding risky situations. If a dangerous or uncomfortable situation arises, it is crucial to immediately report it to mission leaders, as emphasized in the section on dangerous situations and threats. Prompt reporting allows for quick action to ensure safety, such as leaving unsafe locations or situations, and helps prevent potential harm. Listening to spiritual promptings and leaving if necessary are also part of danger prevention, reinforcing the importance of reporting problems immediately to maintain safety and well-being during missionary service.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

"H0w can the challenges faced by new converts in the Church, as described by President Hinckley, be better addressed through fellowshipping and integration of new members into the ward community, especially considering the lack of support from leadership and the difficulties in social transition?","['<1-hop>\n\nhelp teach these principles. President Gordon B. Hinckley related the following concerning the challenges many new converts face: *I received the other day a very interesting letter. It was written by a woman who joined the Church a year ago. She writes: “My journey into the Church was unique and quite challenging. This past year has been the hardest year that I have ever lived in my life. It has also been the most rewarding. As a new member, I continue to be challenged every day.” She goes on to say that when she joined the Church she did not feel support from the leadership in her ward. Her bishop seemed indifferent to her as a new member. Rebuffed, as she felt, she turned back to her mission president, who opened opportunities for her. She states that “Church members don’t know what it is like to be a new member. . . . Therefore, it’s almost impossible for them to know how to support us.” I challenge you, my brothers and sisters, that if you do not know what it is like, you try to imagine what it is like. It can be terribly lonely. It can be disappointing. It can be frightening. We of this Church are far more different from the world than we are prone to think we are. This woman goes on: “When we as investigators become members of the Church, we are surprised to discover that we have entered into a completely foreign world, a world that has its own traditions, culture, and language. We discover that there is no one person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration and anger that we leave. We go back to the world from which we came, where we knew who we were, where we contributed, and where we could speak the language” [Ensign, May 1999, 108].* #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 229) Read the previous account. Write answers to the following questions in your study journal, or discuss them with your companion. Make appropriate goals and plans. - According to this account, what are some of the factors that make it difficult for new members to remain active? - How can having members involved from the beginning of the teaching process help with these challenges? - Think of those you are teaching. How can you better involve members to help investigators begin to make the social transition into the Church? ## Home and Visiting Teaching (Page 229) Stake presidents and bishops, coordinating with the mission president, may use missionaries to visit less-active and part-member families. In appropriate situations, they may request that full-time missionaries participate in home teaching and in visiting teaching. These teaching opportunities should strengthen members, increase the ability of the missionaries to teach, and help missionaries obtain referrals (see “Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). ## Work with the Ward Council to Strengthen New and Less-Active Members (Page 229) Teaching and baptizing investigators is under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity together. You may often be invited to attend ward council and priesthood executive committee meetings. Your first priority is to make sure that your investigators are at Church. Frequently this will mean that you will accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council or priesthood executive committee. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: *“Every new convert needs three things: “1. A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems. “2. An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. . . . “3. Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (Moro. 6:4). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism” (Ensign, May 1999, 106).* The ward council will take the lead in providing a friend, responsibility, and spiritual nourishment for new converts. You will help them as requested. Priesthood leaders and members will do the fellowshipping, with your assistance. ### Friendship (Page 230) - Before baptism and confirmation, ensure that members are present at every lesson, if possible. These members should be with the investigators often to answer their questions, understand their challenges, and encourage them. - Invite members to attend the baptismal service and to welcome new converts into the ward. Members help new converts feel comfortable in various Church meetings. They should also introduce them to other members. - Introduce the investigators to the bishop, his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and other ward leaders as soon as possible. Explain the roles of the bishop and other ward leaders. ### Opportunities to Serve (Page 230) • Help male converts understand and prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. Explain that priesthood quorums provide opportunities to learn, worship, and serve together. • Involve new converts and less-active']","The account highlights that new converts often face feelings of loneliness, frustration, and misunderstanding due to a lack of support from ward leadership and the unfamiliarity of the new church environment. To better address these challenges, it is important for ward members to actively involve themselves from the beginning by being present at lessons, welcoming new members at meetings, and introducing them to ward leaders and other members. Having members serve as friends, providing responsibilities, and offering spiritual nourishment—such as involving new converts in church activities and priesthood quorums—can help them feel more integrated and supported. These efforts align with President Hinckley's counsel that every new convert needs a friend, an assignment, and spiritual nourishment, which collectively facilitate their social and spiritual transition into the ward community, reducing feelings of loneliness and helping them remain active in the Church.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe. If there']","Missionaries can ensure their physical and emotional well-being by adhering to comprehensive health guidelines that include practicing safe food preparation and water safety to prevent illness, engaging in regular exercise to maintain physical health and reduce stress, and managing stress through healthy habits such as prayer, relaxation, and seeking support when needed. Additionally, they should communicate any medical issues to the mission medical coordinator, follow prescribed treatments, and be prepared to respond appropriately in health emergencies by knowing how to contact local emergency services and the mission medical team. These combined efforts, based on the detailed standards provided, help maintain their overall health and resilience during their service.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders.

To prevent danger, always stay where you can see and hear your companion, observe mission standards, and follow common sense safety guidelines such as staying aware of your surroundings, avoiding risky areas, and adhering to local traffic laws and transportation safety protocols. Reporting dangerous situations promptly and following safety protocols are essential to ensure your well-being and effective gospel outreach.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe. If there']","Physical and emotional well-being are important for missionaries to stay healthy and manage stress, which can prevent health emergencies. Proper nutrition, safe food preparation, regular exercise, and stress management practices support overall health. Additionally, making the mission medical coordinator aware of health issues and following guidelines for medical care ensure that missionaries receive appropriate support during health emergencies. Together, these aspects help missionaries maintain their health and respond effectively if emergencies occur.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How do missionary conduct and Christlike qualities relate to following standards and being respectful in your area?,"['<1-hop>\n\nshould be able to see and hear your companion at all times unless you are in the bathroom, in an interview with a mission leader, or conducting a baptismal interview (see 2.3.6). You should sleep in the same room but not the same bed. When doing individual tasks while in your housing, use common sense to protect yourselves and follow missionary standards of behavior (see 3.0). Do not create time to be alone. For example, do not stay up later or get up earlier than your companion. If you and your companion become separated, contact your mission president immediately. > 2.2.3 ### Working in Your Area “Go and labor with [your] mights” (Jacob 5:72), and concentrate your efforts in your assigned teaching area. Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88). You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2). If you need to leave your area for another reason, request permission from your district leader to leave your area within your district or from your zone leaders if you need to travel outside of your district. You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone. If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders. - In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer. - District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district. - Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone. - Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones. - Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president. - A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should: - Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate. - Plan the companion exchange in advance. - Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping. - Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel. - Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching. - Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve. - Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement. - Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange. - Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president. > 2.3.2 ### Transfers The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office. - If your companion is transferred and you are', '<2-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with']","Missionary conduct and Christlike qualities involve developing attributes like kindness, humility, and obedience, which help you follow standards of behavior and show respect to others. For example, being kind and thoughtful, respecting local customs, and acting politely are part of demonstrating Christlike qualities, which align with maintaining missionary standards of behavior and ensuring respectful interactions in your area.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How does the message from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles emphasize fulfilling the great commandments of love for God and neighbor in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\n# Message from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Dear Fellow Missionary: After His Resurrection, Jesus Christ appeared to His disciples and commanded them to “make disciples of” (see Matthew 28:19, footnote a) “all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19–20). You have been called by revelation through God’s chosen servants to assist the Apostles in this great work of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world in order to make disciples of all nations. When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6). To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you. Heavenly Father loves you, and He will help you to love and bless His children wherever you serve. He will empower you and the people you serve, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to be truly “converted unto the Lord” (Alma 23:6). These missionary standards are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They will help protect you physically, spiritually, and emotionally and help you be the disciple Jesus Christ needs you to become. If you have questions about a standard, prayerfully ask the Lord to help you understand its importance, and then if needed, ask your companion, your young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders for help. Regularly study these standards with your companion and strive to obey them. We congratulate you for accepting a call to serve a full-time mission, and we pray you will find true peace and joy in serving the Lord Jesus Christ. First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints # should serve with a sincere desire to help others without any expected outcomes. Follow all service project rules (see 7.2), especially any about not teaching while serving and not serving where you would be alone with children. If someone expresses interest in your message, reply very briefly and arrange to meet with them at a different time and location to share a message. For more information see section 7.2, “Guidelines for Service.” #']","The message highlights that serving a mission with all one's heart helps fulfill the two great commandments: loving the Lord thy God and loving thy neighbor as thyself. It encourages missionaries to be faithful disciples of Jesus Christ, enlarging their talents for God's glory, and emphasizes that through the Atonement, they can be truly converted and effectively serve others, thereby embodying the commandments of love.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
How do safety protocols and danger prevention relate to reporting and handling dangerous or uncomfortable situations during missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nPhysical Well-Being > 4.0 ## Introduction Missionary work requires physical and emotional commitment. The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe. If there', '<2-hop>\n\nis a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders. Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately. For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders. Support and strengthen them through your words and example,']","Safety protocols and danger prevention are essential components of reporting and handling dangerous or uncomfortable situations in missionary work. The context emphasizes that if a problem arises, missionaries should immediately report it to their mission leaders and leave the situation if they feel uncomfortable or threatened. Listening to spiritual promptings and leaving if a location, person, or situation feels unsafe are key safety measures. Additionally, staying where you can see and hear your companion and following mission standards help prevent dangers.

Use the approved communication method that works best for you and your family and that is cost-effective so that you can stay within your monthly budget. This will vary depending on circumstances, location, and schedule. If your parents live in different locations, you may contact each parent separately on preparation day. You also are encouraged to contact your family on other special occasions, such as Christmas, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, your parents’ birthdays, and other holidays that are significant in your home country or culture. You should initiate all text message conversations, online messaging, phone calls, and video chats. If your family needs to contact you, they should contact the mission president first. When communicating with your family by phone or video chat, be wise in determining the duration of your calls. In making these decisions, be considerate of your companion and keep in mind the purpose of your missionary service. > 3.9.2 ### Mission President Write a letter to your mission president weekly on preparation day. Generally, you will submit your letter to him using the Missionary Portal. Only your mission president will review your weekly letter. Be open and honest so that he can understand any concerns you have and provide relevant counsel and feedback. Please be aware that he will read but not be able to respond to every letter. If you receive important news from home that needs immediate attention, inform your mission president and check with him before contacting your family on days other than preparation day or on special occasions. > 3.9.3 ### Communicating with People in Your Mission As you contact people from other areas in your mission, be sure that your communication is focused on fulfilling your missionary purpose. Follow the standards in section 3.5.1, “General Standards for Interacting with Adults,” and in Safeguards for Using Technology, and remember to include your companion as you participate in these communications. > 3.9.4 ### Packages and Letters Some missions may use the mission office address to receive mail and packages and as your return address. This practice can protect your safety and help prevent mail theft and lost mail due to transfers. Please follow all guidelines you receive in such cases. > 3.9.5 ### Missionary Experiences with People from Home You may know a person at home whose personal experience could help someone you are teaching in your mission. You should ask your mission president for permission for that person to share her or his experience and testimony. Counsel with the person about the best communication technology to use. If your family or friends from home want to learn more about the gospel of Jesus Christ, your mission president may allow you to teach them using technology (see 7.5.4). > 3.9.6 ### Personal Visits from Family and Friends Generally, family and friends should not visit you during your mission. However, under special circumstances, your mission president may approve an exception. These visits should be short and not interfere with your missionary duties. A visit should not inconvenience your companion, other missionaries, or the people you teach. Take care that any such visit does not pull your thoughts away from your service or create a financial problem for your family. > 3.9.7 ### Emergencies If your family tells you of an emergency at home, let your mission leaders know so they can give you support. Mission leaders will contact your family if you have an emergency situation. #']","Family communication methods include letters, emails, text messages, online messaging, phone calls, and video chats, which should be chosen based on what works best for the family and is cost-effective to stay within the monthly budget.

You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone. If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders. - In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer. - District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district. - Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone. - Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones. - Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president. - A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should: - Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate. - Plan the companion exchange in advance. - Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping. - Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel. - Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching. - Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve. - Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement. - Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange. - Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president. > 2.3.2 ### Transfers The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office. - If your companion is transferred and you are', '<2-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with']","The m1ssionary conduct and Christlike qual1t1es, such as gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience, are essential for m1ssionar1es to uphold standards of behav1or and stay true to the1r sp1r1tual call1ng.

If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions.

Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need.

For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission.

"How does the message from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles emphasize fulfilling the great commandments of loving God and neighbor in the context of missionary service, and how can missionaries ensure they adhere to these standards to effectively carry out their spiritual calling while maintaining their well-being and cultural sensitivity?","['<1-hop>\n\n# Message from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Dear Fellow Missionary: After His Resurrection, Jesus Christ appeared to His disciples and commanded them to “make disciples of” (see Matthew 28:19, footnote a) “all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19–20). You have been called by revelation through God’s chosen servants to assist the Apostles in this great work of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world in order to make disciples of all nations. When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6). To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you. Heavenly Father loves you, and He will help you to love and bless His children wherever you serve. He will empower you and the people you serve, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to be truly “converted unto the Lord” (Alma 23:6). These missionary standards are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They will help protect you physically, spiritually, and emotionally and help you be the disciple Jesus Christ needs you to become. If you have questions about a standard, prayerfully ask the Lord to help you understand its importance, and then if needed, ask your companion, your young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders for help. Regularly study these standards with your companion and strive to obey them. We congratulate you for accepting a call to serve a full-time mission, and we pray you will find true peace and joy in serving the Lord Jesus Christ. First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints # should serve with a sincere desire to help others without any expected outcomes. Follow all service project rules (see 7.2), especially any about not teaching while serving and not serving where you would be alone with children. If someone expresses interest in your message, reply very briefly and arrange to meet with them at a different time and location to share a message. For more information see section 7.2, “Guidelines for Service.” #']","The message from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles highlights that serving a mission with all one's heart helps fulfill the two great commandments: loving God and loving one's neighbor.

Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts. Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations. > 4.8.3 ### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings. For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.” # Completion of Your Mission > 6.0 ## Introduction Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission. > 6.1 ## Staying Connected Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders.

How does the desire for baptism relate to humbling themselves before God and what steps are involved according to the context?,"['<1-hop>\n\n- Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Be willing to take upon them the name of Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto a remission of their sins. 2. First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve: - Make sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. - Develop faith in Christ. - Repent of transgressions. - Live the principles of moral worthiness. - Live the Word of Wisdom. - Commit to pay tithing. - Receive all the missionary lessons [lessons 1–4 on the Teaching Record and associated commitments]. - Meet the bishop or branch president. - Attend several sacrament meetings. (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002) When an investigator has set a firm baptismal date, schedule when you will complete all the events that lead to baptism and confirmation as listed in your daily planner. Carefully review the Teaching Record to ensure that you have taught the basic doctrines and that the candidates are prepared to address each question in the baptismal interview. Review this schedule with the person in your next meeting. If possible, the person should attend a baptismal service prior to his or her own baptism. If you feel that the person you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule an interview until the investigator meets the standards. If the candidate is a minor, ensure that the parents or guardians have given permission, preferably in writing, for him or her to be baptized. As you help people prepare for their baptismal interview, talk to them about the purpose of the interview. Teach them and bear testimony about the sacredness of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Explain that you want to make sure they understand the principles you have taught and the covenant they will make. Also explain that the interview is an opportunity for them to witness before the Lord’s representative that they are ready for these sacred ordinances. As they keep the covenant made at baptism and confirmation, they will receive a remission of sins. Share the questions the interviewer will ask about their belief in important doctrines, their repentance of past sins, and their willingness to covenant to obey Jesus Christ throughout their lives. Emphasize that baptism by water is incomplete without confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 219) - Read each of the following passages, and make a summary list of the scriptural qualifications for baptism and confirmation. - 2 Nephi 9:23, 31:4-13; 3 Nephi 27:13-21, D&C 20:37 - Mosiah 18:8-10, Moroni 6:1-4, D&C 22 - Alma 7:14-15, Moroni 8:25-26, Acts 2:37-39 - In baptismal interviews, candidates are asked whether they are willing to take upon themselves the name of Christ. What can you do to help them understand this question? As you ponder this question, study the following scriptures: - Mosiah 4–5, Mosiah 18:1–11, Mosiah 26:18, 21–27; 3 Nephi 27:1–10 You may also want to look for other passages that help you understand this principle. ## How to Conduct the Interview (Page 219) The person conducting the interview should use the baptismal interview questions with the guidance of the Spirit to determine whether the baptismal candidate meets the qualifications described in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. He should also adapt the questions to the age and maturity of the candidate. If a candidate does not qualify according to the baptismal interview questions, the baptism and confirmation should be postponed. The investigator should receive additional teaching by the full-time missionaries and fellowshipping from ward members. The district leader or zone leader who conducts the interview should: - Hold the interview in a comfortable, private place, conducive to feeling the Spirit of the Lord. The interviewer’s companion should be nearby. - Open with prayer. - Help the candidate feel comfortable. - Make the interview a spiritually uplifting experience. - Make sure that the candidate understands the purpose of the interview. - Ask the baptismal interview questions. Use follow-up questions to get a feeling for the strength of the person’s testimony and the sincerity of the person’s repentance. - Answer the candidate’s questions. - Invite the person to bear testimony and express his or her feelings. - If the person has challenges with testimony or worthiness, explain that it would be best to postpone the baptism until he or she is better prepared. #### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 220) 1.

Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88). You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2). If you need to leave your area for another reason, request permission from your district leader to leave your area within your district or from your zone leaders if you need to travel outside of your district. You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone. If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders. - In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer. - District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district. - Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone. - Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones. - Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president. - A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should: - Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate. - Plan the companion exchange in advance. - Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping. - Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel. - Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching. - Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve. - Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement. - Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange. - Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president. > 2.3.2 ### Transfers The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office. - If your companion is transferred and you are', '<2-hop>\n\nMissionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with']","Missionary conduct and Christlike qualities are closely connected, as maintaining standards of behavior involves practicing Christlike attributes such as kindness, humility, patience, and obedience. The context emphasizes that missionaries should develop these Christlike attributes through prayer, work, and respectful interactions, which align with the standards of conduct outlined in the guidelines. By embodying Christlike qualities, missionaries uphold their behavior standards, demonstrate love and respect for others, and become more dedicated disciples of Jesus Christ during their service.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe. If there', '<2-hop>\n\nis a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders. Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings.

For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.” > 4.6 ## Housing Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing. For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.” > 4.7 ## Transportation Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook. For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.” > 4.8 ## Money Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity. > 4.8.1 ### Missionary Support Funds Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money. Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following: - Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving. - Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1). - Transportation, including gas or public transportation. - Hair care and personal hygiene items. - Cleaning and laundry supplies. - Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8). - Limited restaurant or fast-food meals. - You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds. See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds. > 4.8.2 ### Personal Funds Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as: - Clothing and shoe replacements. - Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs. - Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions. - Traffic and parking fines. - Repairs to housing if you cause damage. - Audio or video devices. - Souvenirs and gifts.

This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency. Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want. If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders. > 4.9 ## Dress and Appearance As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message. > 4.9.1 ### General Standards for Dress and Appearance Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances. See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites. > 4.9.2 ### General Standards for Grooming Follow healthy grooming standards: - Bathe daily, if possible. - Brush your teeth regularly. - Use deodorant daily. - Wash your hair frequently. - Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet. - Wear sunscreen. - Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain. # Priesthood Authority and Ordinances Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority. When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties. If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings.

As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ## Honesty Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with']","Missionary conduct involves following standards of behavior such as respect, honesty, and safety, as outlined in the guidelines for interactions and behavior.

In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with']","The missionary conduct standards emphasize maintaining respectful, honest, and culturally sensitive behavior, such as following the law of chastity, being honest, and interacting appropriately with others. Developing Christlike qualities like kindness, humility, patience, and love, as described in the scriptures and Preach My Gospel, helps missionaries embody the Savior’s example. Together, these standards and qualities foster trust, respect, and positive relationships with those they serve, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of gospel outreach and supporting the missionaries' well-being.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package. - Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown. - Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17). For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.” > 4.4 ## Medical Care Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns. For your safety: - Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications. - Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve. - If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders. - If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area. For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.” > 4.5 ## Dangerous Situations and Threats Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion.

How does 1 Nephi 19:23 relate to the teachings about the Atonement and the importance of covenants in helping us partake of God's love as described in the vision of the tree of life?,"['<1-hop>\n\nand His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ### Consider This (Page 15) - What is my purpose as a missionary? - What is the gospel? - Why do we preach the gospel? - Why must I teach with power and authority? - What is the message of the Restoration? Why is it so important? - What is my responsibility in helping others become converted? - How will I know whether I am a successful missionary? > Questions to help study this chapter by looking for the answers ## Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 15) You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. All of them are children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (D&C 59:23), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of guilt that come from mistakes and sins. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (2 Nephi 2:6, 8). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, Title Page). As your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great . . . importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (2 Nephi 2:8). President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world. That is the cause that must unite us today. Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167). You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. To come to the Savior they must have faith in Him unto repentance— making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenants of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). ### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11. In this vision, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God (see 1 Nephi 11:21–22). - In the vision, what did the people need to do to be able to partake of the fruit? What do we need to do to receive all the blessings of the Atonement? In what ways do commitments and covenants help us partake of these blessings? - As a missionary, what is your duty in helping others find and partake of the fruits of the gospel? - What did Lehi desire after he had eaten the fruit? (See 1 Nephi 8:10–18.) ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 17) The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for families: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational', '<2-hop>\n\ndefinitions and terms in the ”Ideas for Teaching“ section of each lesson.

As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ### See the Big Picture (Page 37) - Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background. - Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph. - Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain. - Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 37) Read the chapter summaries of the books below and write an outline that describes the setting, main events, and main doctrines of each book. - 1 Nephi - Moses - Acts ### Explore the Details (Page 38) - Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions.

Give your best efforts to help people qualify for “eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (D&C 14:7). #### Remember This (Page 235) - Build strong relationships with the bishop and members of the ward council. - Participate in appropriate ways during priesthood executive committee and ward council meetings. - Be of service to the ward council. When members of the council ask for your help: - Be willing to fellowship converts and less-active members, assist them in their callings and service opportunities, and reteach the missionary lessons. - With members, teach new converts the lesson “Laws and Ordinances.” ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 236) ### Personal Study (Page 236) - Using your daily planner, make plans to talk to new converts and recently activated members about changing their lives and attending church. What has helped them most? In your study journal, write your thoughts about their experiences. What have you learned that will help you in working with your current investigators? - Study 2 Nephi 31:18–20; Alma 26:1–7 and 32:32–43; and Moroni 6. Write what you learn from these verses about strengthening new converts. ### Companion Study (Page 236) - During ward council meeting, ask the bishop if there are any less-active members in your area he would like you to visit this week. As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ### Mission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for', '<2-hop>\n\n## Preach My Gospel (D&C 50:14) (Page 5) | Chapters | First Presidency Message | page no | | --- | --- | --- | | | Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? | vii | | 1 | What Is My Purpose as a Missionary? | 1 | | 2 | How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach? | 17 | | 3 | What Do I Study and Teach? | 29 | | | <li>Lesson 1: The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ</li> | 31 | | | <li>Lesson 2: The Plan of Salvation</li> | 47 | | | <li>Lesson 3: The Gospel of Jesus Christ</li> | 60 | | | <li>Lesson 4: The Commandments</l1? | 71 | | | Lesson 5: Laws and Ordinances | 82 | | 4 | How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit? | 89 | | 5 | What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon? | 103 | | 6 | How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes? | 115 | | 7 | How Can I Better Learn My Mission Language? | 127 | | 8 | How Do I Use Time Wisely? | 137 | | 9 | How Do I Find People to Teach? | 155 | | 10 | How Can I Improve My Teaching Skills? | 175 | | 11 | How Do I Help People Make and Keep Commitments? | 195 | | 12 | How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation? | 203 | | 13 | How Do I Work with Stake and Ward Leaders? | 213 | | |Index | 225 | # First Presidency Message (Page 7) Dear Fellow Missionary: We compliment you on the great opportunity you have to be a missionary. There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ## The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ## Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes),']","D&C 50:14 emphasizes the importance of recognizing and understanding the Spirit, which is essential for pressin forward with a steadfastness in Christ and enduring to the end. D&C 14:7 highlights that the greatest gift of God is eternal life, which we should help others qualify for by building their faith, teaching the Laws and Ordinances, and supporting their spiritual growth. Together, these scriptures underscore that relying on the Spirit and focusing on eternal life are key principles in guiding new converts and members to stay committed and qualify for the greatest of all gifts.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Note how these missionaries responded to difficult questions. - Read the following true account and discuss what you learn concerning the importance and power of the Book of Mormon (names have been changed). “When we invited the Sniders to be baptized and confirmed, Sister Snider was ready, but Brother Snider said, ‘Don’t get your hopes up, Elders. I don’t know if I can ever do this!’ Although Brother Snider accepted what we taught and was always warm and friendly, he was deeply concerned about how his family would react to his joining another church. “After several weeks of watching Brother Snider struggle, my companion and I felt impressed to again read 3 Nephi 11 with the Sniders. I will never forget what happened that night. As we opened the Book of Mormon, my companion explained, ‘This chapter, as you might recall, recounts the Savior’s visit to the people in the Book of Mormon. Here we read about the Savior’s love for these people and what He taught them.’ We each took turns reading a verse or two. After reading through verse 5, my companion interrupted and said, ‘I have always been impressed with the description given here of the voice they heard. The voice was not harsh, it was not loud, and although it was a small voice, it had a powerful piercing effect on them. This voice was not only heard with their ears, but it spoke to their hearts.’ I watched the Sniders as they listened intently to my companion. “After some discussion about prayer and listening to the Spirit, it was Brother Snider’s turn to read: ‘And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them: Behold my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.’ Brother Snider paused, looking intently at his Book of Mormon. Then he looked up at me and said, ‘Heavenly Father was really proud of His Son, wasn’t He?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. Brother Snider looked back at his book again and stared at the open pages as if deep in thought. Finally he said, ‘I would want Heavenly Father to be proud of me too. I wonder how He would introduce me. I guess, if I . . . well, if I want Him to be proud of me then I had better do what He wants me to do.’ ‘Yes, I think that would be important,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ Brother Snider continued. ‘I think I’ve been worrying too much about what everybody else thinks and not enough about what God thinks.’ After a brief pause Brother Snider nodded and with a determined look said, ‘I think I had better be baptized.’ His response was so unexpected that my companion and I looked at him with blank stares. Finally, my companion said, ‘Yes, that would be the right thing to do. In fact, later on in this chapter the Savior teaches . . .’ As my companion talked I felt a burning in my heart and gratitude for the power of the Book of Mormon.” How did these missionaries use the Book of Mormon? How will you and your companion use it more effectively in your missionary efforts? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 127) - Practice using the Book of Mormon in each of the ways mentioned in the main headings of this chapter. - List objections or questions raised by investigators. Explain to each other how you would answer these questions using the Book of Mormon. - Read Book of Mormon passages together. Share knowledge, feelings, and testimony. - Practice using the Book of Mormon to confirm the message of the Restoration. - Select one of the great Book of Mormon missionaries. Discuss and have missionaries list the characteristics of this missionary. Invite each missionary to set a goal', '<2-hop>\n\nSet Goals (Page 160) Goals reflect the desires of our hearts and our vision of what we can accomplish. Through goals and plans, our hopes are transformed into action. Goal setting and planning are acts of faith. Prayerfully set goals that are in harmony with the Savior’s command to “teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Matthew 28:19). Set goals for each key indicator. You may also set goals for your personal development. Do everything within your power to achieve your goals while respecting the agency of others. The ultimate measure of success is not in achieving goals alone but in the service you render and the progress of others. Goals are a means of helping you bring about much good among Heavenly Father’s children. They are not to be used to receive recognition. Carefully considered goals will give you clear direction and will help you fill your days with activities that help people strengthen their faith in the Savior and progress toward baptism, confirmation, and full activity in the Church. Challenging goals will help you work effectively and lead you to stretch and grow. Follow the guidelines below as you set goals: - Follow the Spirit. - Focus on the key indicators. - Focus on people. Although you will use numbers, be able to support your numbers with the names of people where possible. - Be specific and realistic, but set goals that will make you stretch. - Set weekly and daily goals. - Set goals for personal and companion study, including language study if you are learning another language. - Measure your progress each day, each week, and after each six-week period. When you fall short of a goal, evaluate your efforts and seek for ways to accomplish the goal. If needed, adjust your expectations. Over time your mission president may establish standards of excellence or mission goals intended to raise your vision and increase your faith. District, zone, and mission standards will help you stretch, work effectively, and reach higher levels of performance. They are not to be used as quotas that impose specific goals on you and your companion. “I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential. When one learns to master the principles of setting a goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he attains in this life.” – ELDER M. RUSSELL BALLARD TALK GIVEN TO SALT LAKE AREA YOUNG ADULTS, OCT. 18, 1981 #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 161) Set weekly goals for each indicator. For each goal, ask yourselves: - Are there names associated with the number? - Is the goal specific? - Is the goal realistic? - Will the goal make us stretch? - Are we committed to this goal? Discuss each goal. If necessary, determine how you might revise it and why. ## The Weekly Planning Session (Page 161) Once you have set goals, decide how you will achieve them. You and your companion should hold a weekly planning session on a day and at a time that is less productive for proselyting, such as Thursday or Friday morning. Your mission president will set the day and time of the weekly planning session. This weekly planning may take two to three hours to complete. Your discussion should focus on the needs of people and how to help them progress. During this weekly planning session, review past goals and set new goals for the coming week. Consider every aspect of your proselyting. Sunday evening is the recommended time for the weekly call-in report. A Sunday- evening report provides the most accurate and timely status of the mission because most baptisms and confirmations take place on Saturday or Sunday. Because the day you hold your weekly planning session is likely to be different from your reporting day, approach your weekly planning with 10 days in mind. For example, if your weekly planning session is on Thursday, you will review the progress on your goals so far that week, and you will plan what you need to do to achieve these goals through Sunday. Then, set goals and make plans for the next week from Monday to Sunday. On Sunday evening you will total and report the results from the past week, and you will have your plan ready for the coming week. Below is a description of how the planning guidelines apply to a weekly planning session. 1. Pray for and seek inspiration. Before you begin, have your Missionary Daily Planner and area book near. Begin your planning session with prayer. Seek inspiration as you discuss the needs of people and plan how to serve them and help them progress in the gospel. Pray specifically for your investigators. Have the faith to ask Heavenly Father to bless them with answers to their prayers, with a desire to attend church, and so forth. 2. Set goals and make plans for investigators to be baptized and confirmed in the coming week. Review the Teaching Record for each person who is committed to be baptized or confirmed in the coming week. Discuss the arrangements you need to make for baptismal interviews, services, and confirmations. Using the Teaching Record, discuss any commitments these people may be struggling with and how you can help them. Plan to make daily contact with them. Discuss how you can help the ward mission leader coordinate with the bishop for their confirmations in sacrament meeting. 3. Set goals and make plans for investigators with a baptismal date. Review the Teaching Record for each person who will be baptized in the coming weeks. Talk about lessons you need to teach them. Consider how you can help them']","The context shows that Matthew in the Bible, particularly in Matthew 28:19, emphasizes the command to teach all nations and baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The Book of Mormon references Matthew's teachings, such as in 3 Nephi 11, where the Savior teaches about baptism and becoming like Him. Missionaries use these scriptures to help investigators understand the importance of following Christ's example and making commitments like baptism. The themes highlight that setting goals, prayerfully planning, and using scriptures from Matthew and related passages in the Book of Mormon can strengthen missionary efforts. By focusing on Christ's teachings in Matthew and applying them through scripture study and goal setting, missionaries can more effectively guide investigators toward faith, baptism, and full activity in the church.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does Jacob 4:8 illustrate the importance of studying the gospel effectively, and how can this principle help missionaries gain faith and testimony as emphasized in the context of gospel study and bearing testimony?","['<1-hop>\n\nnew members. > Beginning of Chapter 2 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach? (Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 32) Read Joseph Smith—History 1:11–13. Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.” – PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER “LITTLE CHILDREN,” ENSIGN, NOV. 1986, 17 #### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ## Studying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain', '<2-hop>\n\nthis principle help people gain faith and testimony? - How will this commitment help people repent and be more sensitive to the Spirit? ## Bear Testimony Frequently (Page 212) A testimony is a spiritual witness and assur- ance given by the Holy Ghost. To bear testimony is to give a simple, direct declaration of belief—a feeling, an assurance, a conviction of gospel truth. Sharing your testimony often is one of the most powerful ways of inviting the Spirit and helping others feel the Spirit. It adds a current, personal witness to the truths you have taught from the scriptures. An effective missionary teaches, testifies, and invites others to do things that build faith in Jesus Christ. This includes making promises that come from living true principles. For example, a missionary might say, “I know as you keep the Sabbath day holy, you will find more peace in your heart.” For your testimony to have convincing power, you must be sincere. Powerful testimony is not dependent on eloquence or the volume of your voice but on the conviction of your heart. Strive daily to strengthen your understanding and conviction of the doctrines and principles you are to teach. Bear testimony often to seal the truth of the principles or doctrine you are teaching. As often as possible, teach, then testify, and testify as you teach. Your testimony may be as simple as “Jesus Christ is the Son of God” or “I have learned for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.” You may also share a brief experience about how you gained this knowledge. Bear testimony several times in each lesson, not just at the end. Bear testimony that what your companion has taught is from God. Bear testimony that the principle you are going to teach will bless the investigators’ lives if they will follow it. Talk about how living a principle has blessed your life. People may sometimes intellectually question what you teach, but it is difficult to question a sincere, heartfelt testimony. When you testify, pray that those you are teaching will feel the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. When you testify, you help create an environment for investigators to feel the Holy Ghost confirming your witness of the truth. This prepares them to accept the commitments you will extend. Brigham Young was not baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the first year of his learning about the restored gospel. But of his conversion he said: “If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared, in the most exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it by learning and worldly wisdom, they would have been to me like smoke which arises only to vanish away. But when I saw a man without eloquence or talents for public speaking, who could only say, ‘I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord,’ the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my understanding, and a light, glory, and immortality were before me. I was encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself that the testimony of the man was true” (in Journal of Discourses, 1:90). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 213) The passages below are examples of bearing testimony. Read each of the questions and scriptures. Write your answers in your study journal. - In these verses, of what do the apostles and prophets testify? - How strongly do they believe what they are saying? How can you tell that they are convinced of the truth? - When you say, “I know that ________ is true,” what do you mean? What other words can you use to convey your convictions? - Jacob 7:7–12, Alma 5:45–48, Alma 34:1, 8; Acts 2:14–38, Acts 10:34–44, D&C 76:22–24, John 3:3–11 #### Scripture Study (Page 214) - What are some principles and promises of bearing testimony? - 2 Nephi 33:1, D&C 62:3, D&C 84:61, D&C 100:5–8, John 15:26 ## Follow Up (Page 214) Extending an invitation without following up is like beginning a journey without finishing it or buying a ticket to a concert without going into the theater. Without the completed action, the commitment is hollow. Change can be hard. Your role is to help strengthen people in their resolve to change. You should do all you can to help people keep their commitments. Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time especially for commandments such as chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and tithing. As you and ward leaders work with people to help them keep their commitments, show understanding. Be patient but persistent. You have not finished your ministry until people are living these commitments, or in other words, until they have repented (see 3 Nephi 18:32). Sometimes several visits may be necessary for you to help people develop strong enough faith in a principle to lead to repentance. Following up begins when you first visit and teach people: - Have them write their commitment on something you leave with them, such as a pamphlet or a card with your names and phone number. - Make sure people know that you will make brief, daily visits between teaching appointments. Explain that your purpose is to support and help them. Give them an idea of what you will do during those visits. - Make specific notes in the Notes/To Do List section of your planner to follow up tomorrow on every commitment invitation you have extended today. Make frequent contact, daily if possible, to find out how people are progressing with their commitments, answer questions, help them overcome challenges, teach additional lessons, read together from the Book of Mormon, share passages of scripture, or use audiovisual materials. As you visit people often, you will strengthen the spiritual feelings they felt as you taught them']","Jacob 4:8 highlights that learning the gospel involves receiving revelation through diligent study and the Holy Ghost, emphasizing that understanding comes as we seek and ponder the words of eternal life. The context explains that effective gospel study requires prayer, desire, and action, allowing the Holy Ghost to open our minds and hearts to greater light and understanding. This principle helps missionaries gain faith and testimony by encouraging them to study with real intent, seek the Spirit’s guidance, and treasure up the words of scripture and prophets. As they do so, their conviction of gospel truths deepens, enabling them to bear sincere testimony that can influence others and invite the Spirit, ultimately strengthening their own faith and that of those they teach.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does diligent work in missionary service, motivated by love for the Lord, relate to developing Christlike attributes and inviting the Spirit as emphasized in the teachings of Ezra Taft Benson?","['<1-hop>\n\n135) Diligence is steady, consistent, earnest, and energetic effort in doing the Lord’s work. The Lord expects you to work diligently—persistently and with great effort and care. A diligent missionary works effectively and efficiently. Diligence in missionary work is an expression of your love for the Lord and His work. When you are diligent, you find joy and satisfaction in your work. Do many good things of your own free will (see D&C 58:27). Don’t wait for your leaders to tell you what to do. Continue until you have done all you can, even when you are tired. Focus on the most important things and avoid wasting time. Pray for guidance and strength. Plan regularly and effectively. Avoid anything that distracts your thoughts or actions. “I have often said one of the greatest secrets of missionary work is work! If a missionary works, he will get the Spirit; if he gets the Spirit, he will teach by the Spirit; and if he teaches by the Spirit, he will touch the hearts of the people and he will be happy. There will be no homesickness, no worrying about families, for all time and talents and interests are centered on the work of the ministry. Work, work, work—there is no satisfactory substitute, especially in missionary work.” – PRESIDENT EZRA TAFT BENSON THE TEACHINGS OF EZRA TAFT BENSON (1988), 200 #### Scripture Study (Page 136) - What does it mean to be diligent? - Moroni 9:6 D&C 10:4, D&C 107:99–100 - Why does the Lord expect you to be diligent? - D&C 75:2–5, D&C 123:12–14, D&C 127:4 - How does diligence relate to agency? - Mosiah 4:26–27, D&C 58:26–29, Topical Guide, “Diligence, Diligent, Diligently” D&C 130:20–21 ## Obedience (Page 136) As a missionary, you are expected to keep the commandments willingly, to obey mission rules, and to follow the counsel of your leaders. Obedience is the first law of heaven. It is an act of faith. You may sometimes be required to do things you do not completely understand. As you obey, you increase in faith, knowledge, wisdom, testimony, protection, and freedom. Strive to be obedient to the Lord, the living prophet, and your mission president. “The discipline contained in daily obedience and clean living and wholesome lives builds an armor around you of protection and safety from the temptations that beset you as you proceed through mortality.” – ELDER L.

How does the guidance from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles emphasize the importance of adhering to standards and serving with love in the context of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?,"['<1-hop>\n\nfor Baptism: 2 Nephi 9:23, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 7:14–15, 3 Nephi 11:23–27, Moroni 6:1–4, D&C 20:37, Acts 2:37–39 - The Lord Institutes the Sacrament: 3 Nephi 18:1–18, Luke 22:15–20 - Promised Blessings of Baptism: Mosiah 4:11–12, 26, Moroni 8:25–26, John 3:5, Romans 6:4 - The Sacrament Prayers: Moroni 4 and 5, D&C 20:75–79 - Partaking of the Sacrament: D&C 27:2, 1 Corinthians 11:23–29 - Necessity for Authority: D&C 22, Hebrews 5:4 > Lesson Three: Fifth Principle ## The Gift of the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson.

You have been called by revelation through God’s chosen servants to assist the Apostles in this great work of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world in order to make disciples of all nations. When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6). To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you. Heavenly Father loves you, and He will help you to love and bless His children wherever you serve. He will empower you and the people you serve, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to be truly “converted unto the Lord” (Alma 23:6). These missionary standards are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They will help protect you physically, spiritually, and emotionally and help you be the disciple Jesus Christ needs you to become. If you have questions about a standard, prayerfully ask the Lord to help you understand its importance, and then if needed, ask your companion, your young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders for help. Regularly study these standards with your companion and strive to obey them. We congratulate you for accepting a call to serve a full-time mission, and we pray you will find true peace and joy in serving the Lord Jesus Christ. First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints # should serve with a sincere desire to help others without any expected outcomes. Follow all service project rules (see 7.2), especially any about not teaching while serving and not serving where you would be alone with children. If someone expresses interest in your message, reply very briefly and arrange to meet with them at a different time and location to share a message. For more information see section 7.2, “Guidelines for Service.” #']","The guidance from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles highlights that serving a mission with all one's heart helps fulfill the commandments to love God and love one's neighbor, which are central themes in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It encourages missionaries to enlarge their talents and skills for the glory of God, emphasizing that Jesus Christ will magnify their efforts. The message also underscores the importance of obeying standards to protect oneself physically, spiritually, and emotionally, and to become a true disciple of Christ.

"How can involving members from the beginning, as emphasized in the Ensign, help new members overcome the challenges of feeling unsupported and entering a foreign world, as described in the account related to the Ensign themes?","['<1-hop>\n\nhelp teach these principles. President Gordon B. Hinckley related the following concerning the challenges many new converts face: *I received the other day a very interesting letter. It was written by a woman who joined the Church a year ago. She writes: “My journey into the Church was unique and quite challenging. This past year has been the hardest year that I have ever lived in my life. It has also been the most rewarding. As a new member, I continue to be challenged every day.” She goes on to say that when she joined the Church she did not feel support from the leadership in her ward. Her bishop seemed indifferent to her as a new member. Rebuffed, as she felt, she turned back to her mission president, who opened opportunities for her. She states that “Church members don’t know what it is like to be a new member. . . . Therefore, it’s almost impossible for them to know how to support us.” I challenge you, my brothers and sisters, that if you do not know what it is like, you try to imagine what it is like. It can be terribly lonely. It can be disappointing. It can be frightening. We of this Church are far more different from the world than we are prone to think we are. This woman goes on: “When we as investigators become members of the Church, we are surprised to discover that we have entered into a completely foreign world, a world that has its own traditions, culture, and language. We discover that there is no one person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration and anger that we leave. We go back to the world from which we came, where we knew who we were, where we contributed, and where we could speak the language” [Ensign, May 1999, 108].* #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 229) Read the previous account. Write answers to the following questions in your study journal, or discuss them with your companion. Make appropriate goals and plans. - According to this account, what are some of the factors that make it difficult for new members to remain active? - How can having members involved from the beginning of the teaching process help with these challenges? - Think of those you are teaching. How can you better involve members to help investigators begin to make the social transition into the Church? ## Home and Visiting Teaching (Page 229) Stake presidents and bishops, coordinating with the mission president, may use missionaries to visit less-active and part-member families. In appropriate situations, they may request that full-time missionaries participate in home teaching and in visiting teaching. These teaching opportunities should strengthen members, increase the ability of the missionaries to teach, and help missionaries obtain referrals (see “Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). ## Work with the Ward Council to Strengthen New and Less-Active Members (Page 229) Teaching and baptizing investigators is under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity together. You may often be invited to attend ward council and priesthood executive committee meetings. Your first priority is to make sure that your investigators are at Church. Frequently this will mean that you will accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council or priesthood executive committee. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: *“Every new convert needs three things: “1. A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems. “2. An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. . . . “3. Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (Moro. 6:4). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism” (Ensign, May 1999, 106).* The ward council will take the lead in providing a friend, responsibility, and spiritual nourishment for new converts. You will help them as requested. Priesthood leaders and members will do the fellowshipping, with your assistance. ### Friendship (Page 230) - Before baptism and confirmation, ensure that members are present at every lesson, if possible. These members should be with the investigators often to answer their questions, understand their challenges, and encourage them. - Invite members to attend the baptismal service and to welcome new converts into the ward. Members help new converts feel comfortable in various Church meetings. They should also introduce them to other members. - Introduce the investigators to the bishop, his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and other ward leaders as soon as possible. Explain the roles of the bishop and other ward leaders. ### Opportunities to Serve (Page 230) • Help male converts understand and prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. Explain that priesthood quorums provide opportunities to learn, worship, and serve together. • Involve new converts and less-active', '<2-hop>\n\nrestored gospel can be a blessing to their families. - Look for clues—such as items in homes or yards, lettering on clothing, or indications of children—to help you know how to begin talking with people. - Listen sincerely to what people say to you. - Be warm, friendly, and cheerful. Offer to help. - Trust the Spirit to put into your heart and mind what to teach. - Invite everyone to learn about the restored gospel. - Offer pass-along cards. - Ask for the names of people’s acquaintances who might be interested in your message. As you read the following true account, look for how the man was prepared to receive the missionaries and how the missionaries used an unplanned opportunity to teach him the gospel. As a child, I was never taught to read the Bible. I went to church on Sundays, but I contributed nothing and felt nothing in return. I was disillusioned by my religion. . . . I searched for . . . God—wanting to know if He even existed. I thirsted to know Him and His words. But I could not seem to find what I sought. There were moments when I felt close to quenching my thirst. When I held my first child, a daughter, in my arms for the first time, I had a feeling that God really did exist. Many years later, when her sister was born, I experienced the same feeling. . . . Most of the time, however, an inexplicable tiredness weighed upon my soul. I was spiritually thirsty and could find no place to drink. In April 1994 I was living in the city of Monterrey, Mexico, earning a living as a taxi driver. One day it rained for hours, sending water cascading down the mountainsides. After driving around in the rain for hours, I found myself in a little town about eight kilometers (five miles) from Monterrey. It was about . . . nearly time to go home. Suddenly I saw two young men on foot. They were wearing dark trousers and white shirts, and they looked drenched from head to foot. When I approached them, I opened the door of the taxi and called, “Get in! I’m going to Monterrey.” The taller one, who had a very fair complexion, replied, “We don’t have any money.” “No charge,” I replied. They quickly got into the taxi. As I drove, we talked. They asked if they could share a message about Jesus Christ with me. I agreed and gave them my address. When I got home, I woke my wife and told her about the two young men. “What a coincidence,” I said. “One is Mexican and the other is American, and they are both named Elder.” “Elder means missionary,” my wife answered, knowing just a little about the Church. From deep within me, I felt something stir. These young men had left a feeling of exquisite wonder in my heart. I felt that I was close to finding the water that would quench my thirst, that it was within reach. The missionaries came to our home on 5 June, and I was happy to listen to them. Two weeks later, on 19 June, I was baptized. My wife was baptized four months later, in October. Our oldest daughter had been receiving religious training at a school. When she went to church for the first time, she cried, “Papa, this is so much better than what I am learning at school!” She too was baptized in October. In December 1995 we were sealed as a family in the Mexico City Mexico Temple for this life and for eternity. Now we are a family enjoying harmony, peace, and happiness. We know who we worship. We know where we came from and where we are going. We love God’s word, especially the Book of Mormon, and we love His Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Through these gifts we have found that well of living water the Savior spoke of to the woman of Samaria: “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:14). [Victor Manuel Cabrera, “Thirsting for the Living Water,” Ensign, Aug. 2001, 60–61] #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 172) - How had the man been prepared for the restored gospel? - What would have happened if the elders had never opened their mouths to share a gospel message? - Review what you did yesterday. Did you talk with as many people as possible? If not, make plans and set goals to do so today. #### Scripture study (Page 172) What does the Lord say about opening your mouth? What should you teach?

When you meet people, be prepared to teach brief summaries of restored truth so that the Holy Ghost can bear witness that you are the servants of the Lord. In many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to . . .""* If a little more time is available, you might say more: *""Our message is simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us.']","Involving members from the beginning, as highlighted in the Ensign, provides new members with a supportive friend, responsibilities, and spiritual nourishment, which are essential for their social and spiritual transition into the Church. The account illustrates that new members often feel lonely, unsupported, and overwhelmed by a foreign culture within the Church. By ensuring members are present at lessons, encouraging them to participate in Church activities, and introducing them to ward leaders, the ward council helps new members build relationships and feel included. President Gordon B. Hinckley's emphasis on friendship, responsibility, and nourishment aligns with the account's depiction of how support and involvement from members can alleviate feelings of frustration and anger, helping new members stay active and feel part of the Church community.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does Ezra Taft Benson emphasize the importance of diligence and obedience in missionary work, and how can reading the Book of Mormon strengthen a missionary's resolve to develop Christlike attributes as taught by Benson?","['<1-hop>\n\n135) Diligence is steady, consistent, earnest, and energetic effort in doing the Lord’s work.

How were they blessed? = Alma 56:45–48, Alma 57:21–27 ## Developing Christlike Attributes (Page 136) As you study and seek to develop the attributes described in this chapter and other attributes found in the scriptures, the following pattern may be helpful: - Identify the attribute you wish to develop. - Write a definition and description of the attribute. - Record questions to answer as you study. - List and study thoroughly passages of scripture that teach about the attribute. - Record your feelings and impressions. - Set goals and make plans to apply the attribute in your life. - Pray for the Lord to help you develop the attribute. - Evaluate your progress periodically in developing each attribute. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 137) Identify an attribute from this chapter or from the scriptures. Follow the pattern found above to understand better and to plan for developing the attribute. Look at the image of the name tag. How does your name tag differ from that worn by an employee of a company? Note that the two most prominent parts are your name and the Savior’s name. How can you ensure that you represent the Savior as one of His disciples? Why is it important for people to associate your name with the Savior’s in a positive way? Write your thoughts in your study journal. #### Scripture Study (Page 137) - What are some attributes listed in the scriptures? - Mosiah 3:19, Alma 7:23, D&C 4, D&C 121:41–45, Articles of Faith 1:13, Philippians 4:8, 2 Peter 1:5–8 #### Remember This (Page 137) - You need to be a Christlike missionary, not just do missionary things. - Learning to be like Christ is a lifelong pursuit. - You follow Christ’s example—develop His attributes—one action and decision at a time. - Changing to become Christlike requires exercising faith, repenting, keeping covenants, receiving an increased measure of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.', '<2-hop>\n\nprayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts . . . the Spirit of the Lord. There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“The Power of the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, June 1988, 6). ## Use the Book of Mormon to Respond to Objections (Page 122) Many people will not believe everything you teach. President Ezra Taft Benson taught how the Book of Mormon can be the central resource in responding to such situations: “We are to use the Book of Mormon in handling objections to the Church. . . . “. . . All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. . . . The only problem the objector has to resolve forhimself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation. “Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively. We are not obligated to answer every objection. Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand” (A Witness and a Warning, 4–5). For example, sincere investigators might object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom. Help them see that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation. You might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.” Investigators must resolve for themselves their concerns and objections. You can help as you focus them on what will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. When they strengthen their testimony of the Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections and concerns. As you answer concerns, remember that our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his successors—who receive direct revelation from God. There- fore, the first question for an investigator to answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. #### Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon (Page 123) One way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 123) In your study journal, write down how you would refer to Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon to respond to the following objections or concerns: - “I don’t believe that God speaks to people anymore.” - “I believe that I can worship God in my own way rather than through some organized religion.” - “Why must I give up drinking wine with my meals if I join your church?” - “Why do I need religion?”']","Ezra Taft Benson highlights that diligence involves steady, consistent, and energetic effort in doing the Lord’s work, emphasizing that work is a key to spiritual success and happiness in missionary efforts. He also teaches that obedience to commandments and mission rules is fundamental, as it builds faith, protection, and testimony. Reading the Book of Mormon prayerfully can deepen a missionary’s spiritual strength, reinforce their obedience, and inspire them to develop Christlike attributes. Benson encourages missionaries to use the Book of Mormon as a central resource to respond to objections and to strengthen their faith, which in turn supports diligent and obedient service. By following Benson’s teachings, missionaries can better embody Christlike qualities such as diligence, obedience, and faith, ultimately becoming more effective in their gospel outreach.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the teaching of D&C 14:8 and D&C 84:85 help us understand the importance of helping people accept the gospel and make commitments, especially considering the truths restored through Joseph Smith about God's plan and the Book of Mormon?","['<1-hop>\n\n#### Activity: Companion Study (Page 191) With your companion, practice different ways to begin a lesson using several of these suggestions. ## Adjust Your Teaching to Meet Needs (Page 191) Each person or family you teach is unique. Even though you will not understand all of their interests, achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to their circumstances. Regardless of needs or problems, all people are best helped as they accept and live the gospel. You will be able to adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the Spirit. You may alter the order of the lessons as you are inspired to adapt to the investigators’ interests and needs. You may use more than one meeting to teach the principles in one lesson, and occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons in a single meeting. Heavenly Father knows His children, so rely on inspiration to make these decisions as you teach. Pray for the gift of discernment, and pay attention to thoughts that come to your mind or feelings you have about what to teach. You will need to adjust your teaching to give more attention to those commitments that are more difficult for an investigator to keep. For example, one person may easily accept the Book of Mormon as the word of God, while another may struggle to accept anything but the Bible. One person may have trouble giving up tobacco but will readily accept the law of tithing. As you plan when to teach certain doctrines, be sensitive about how much new information you share. Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the investigators. Some will progress faster or slower than others. Make sure that you ask enough questions and listen carefully to their answers so you have a firm understanding of how quickly and how well the investigator is learning and applying the doctrines you are presenting. Be sensitive to time. Most teaching appointments should not last beyond 45 minutes. A teaching visit can be completed, however, in 15 or 20 minutes if needed. If the person has only 15 minutes to meet with you, adjust your teaching to respect that limitation. Trust in the promise that the Spirit will give you “in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say” (D&C 100:6). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 192) Imagine that you are walking down the street and notice an older man struggling to place some heavy bags into a garbage can. You and your companion help him, and as a result he asks who you are. After some discussion he invites you into his home and agrees to hear your message. During the initial conversation he tells you that: - His wife died a year ago, and he really misses her. - He tires easily because of a heart condition. - He wonders more now than ever before whether God exists. What might you teach him? How could you adjust your teaching to best meet his needs and concerns? #### Scripture Study (page 192) - What does it mean to give “that portion that shall be meted unto every man”? - Alma 29:8, D&C 84:85 - What has the Lord promised faithful missionaries? - D&C 68:2–4, D&C 100:5–8, Matthew 10:19–20 ## Teach with Your Companion in Unity (Page 192) The Lord has commanded, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” (D&C 42:6). Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work together in unity. As you plan and study each day, discuss how you will teach so that you can be united and teach with one voice. Your teaching will be more powerful if you and your companion alternate giving brief portions of the lesson. Avoid falling into a routine when presenting the message. Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths of which he or she has testified. Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something. As companions, be ready to yield to each other so that you do not hinder the guidance of the Spirit. When you speak, maintain eye contact with the investigator. When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the investigator’s responses. #### Scripture Study (Page 193) - How do companions support one another? - Alma 12:1, D&C 42:6, D&C 52:9–10 ## Invite Members to Help You Teach (Page 193) Whenever possible invite members, preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the investigators. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of missionary work. It also provides friendship for the investigator. President Thomas S. Monson taught: *During the teaching process investigators can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new investigators so that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps the second or third visit. Can you appreciate, for example, when missionaries are working with those from the United Church of Canada, the strength of', '<2-hop>\n\nSome important truths restored through Joseph Smith include the knowledge that God is our Father and that we are His spirit children, that we lived with Him before birth, and that families can live together forever in God’s presence through Christ’s Atonement by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel. The Book of Mormon is evidence of the love of God for His children. It shows that God speaks to His children. As you teach and testify, invite people to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its message. Each person you teach must decide whether to accept the Book of Mormon as revelation from God. Trust the remarkable promise in Moroni 10:3–5. Do all you can to persuade people to read the book, understand it, and ask God sincerely whether it is true. The witness of the Holy Ghost becomes the cornerstone of their faith that Christ has restored His Church. Help those you teach to receive that spiritual confirmation. #### Scripture Study (Page 22) How should you use the Book of Mormon in your missionary work? - Read 1 Nephi 13:39 2 Nephi 29:8–10, Moroni 10:3–5 D&C 20:5–16, D&C 42:12–14 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 22) Imagine that you are going to write an article about the message of the Restoration for a local newspaper. In your study journal write a title that describes the central message. Then record your thoughts and feelings about this message, including how understanding it better has changed the way you live and the way you view the world around you. ## Helping Others Make Commitments: The Door to Faith and Repentance (Page 22) Help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “The first thing you will do when an investigator tells you he or she had not read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! . . . Much of the time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the balance. . . . It is the most important path this investigator will ever walk. But if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! . . . So take control of this situation. Teach with power and authority, and then be devastated if the first steps toward commandment-keeping and covenant-keeping have not been successfully begun” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1997). As you teach people to understand the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel, you “declare repentance” (D&C 15:6). Repentance involves a change of heart and a desire to forsake sin and serve God. It involves humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to God’s will. It requires that people increase their commitment to live in agreement with God’s will. Repentance requires a sincere and lasting change of thoughts, desires, habits, and actions. It is a positive experience that brings joy and peace. Be bold and loving in helping people understand what they must do to repent. By inviting people to make commitments, you can effectively raise a voice of both warning and hope. #### Scripture Study (Page 22) What do these scriptures teach about declaring repentance? - Read Alma 29:1–4 Alma 42:31, Alma 62:45 D&C 14:8, and D&C 15:6; 16:6 for answersto the question. ## Baptism and Confirmation (Page 23) Baptizing and confirming the people you teach is central to your purpose. Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost brings a host of blessings to those who live worthy of it. Through these ordinances people enter the gate and continue on the path to eternal life. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said: “We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church. We do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives. . . . We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the sons and daughters of God. No one else can do this” (“The Purpose of Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1995). As you teach the restored gospel, help people understand the sacred nature of baptism and confirmation. Help them realize that receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is a great blessing in this life and a key to their salvation. The Holy Ghost will “teach [them] all things” (John 14:26). President Boyd K. Packer taught: “When you are teaching investigators and preparing them for baptism by water, you must also think of the gift of the Holy Ghost— baptism by fire. Think of it as one sentence. First comes the baptism of water and then the baptism of fire” (“The Gift of the Holy Ghost: What Every Missionary Should Know—and Every Member As Well,” seminar for new mission presidents, June 2003). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 5:499). Help those you teach understand that to qualify for baptism and confirmation they must meet the conditions given in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. ### D&C 20:37 Qualifications for Baptism (page 23) - Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Are willing to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins. After']","Teaching from D&C 14:8 and D&C 84:85 emphasizes the significance of helping individuals accept the gospel and make commitments that lead to salvation. D&C 14:8 promises that if we keep the commandments, we will receive eternal life, highlighting the importance of obedience and commitment. D&C 84:85 stresses the need to teach the gospel with power and authority, inviting others to accept the truths of God's plan. Considering the restored truths through Joseph Smith—such as that God is our Father, that we are His spirit children, and that families can be together forever—these principles underscore the importance of guiding others to understand and accept the gospel. The Book of Mormon serves as evidence of God's love and His communication with His children, inviting them to read, pray, and receive spiritual confirmation. By helping people understand these foundational truths and encouraging them to make commitments, we support their spiritual growth and prepare them for sacred ordinances like baptism and confirmation, which are essential steps on the path to eternal life.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"Based on the guidance provided on pages 84 and 243, how can missionaries effectively help new converts and less-active members strengthen their faith and prepare for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, considering the importance of building relationships and teaching the commandments in the right sequence as emphasized in these pages?","['<1-hop>\n\nbeloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; . . . ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:19–20). Give your best efforts to help people qualify for “eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (D&C 14:7). #### Remember This (Page 235) - Build strong relationships with the bishop and members of the ward council. - Participate in appropriate ways during priesthood executive committee and ward council meetings. - Be of service to the ward council. When members of the council ask for your help: - Be willing to fellowship converts and less-active members, assist them in their callings and service opportunities, and reteach the missionary lessons. - With members, teach new converts the lesson “Laws and Ordinances.” ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 236) ### Personal Study (Page 236) - Using your daily planner, make plans to talk to new converts and recently activated members about changing their lives and attending church. What has helped them most? In your study journal, write your thoughts about their experiences. What have you learned that will help you in working with your current investigators? - Study 2 Nephi 31:18–20; Alma 26:1–7 and 32:32–43; and Moroni 6. Write what you learn from these verses about strengthening new converts. ### Companion Study (Page 236) - During ward council meeting, ask the bishop if there are any less-active members in your area he would like you to visit this week. As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ### Mission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for', ""<2-hop>\n\nyou be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 84) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - What does it mean to repent? - Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost an essential part of the gospel? - Why is it important for you to be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Was there anything about our Church meetings that you did not understand? - What did you enjoy about our Church meetings? ### Key Definitions (Page 84) - **Confirmation:** The laying on of hands by those holding the Melchizedek Priesthood in order to become a member of the Church and to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. - **Covenant:** An agreement between God and His children. We do not act as equals in the agreement. God gives the conditions for the covenant, and we agree to do what He asks us to do. God then promises us certain blessings for our obedience. We receive ordinances by covenant. When we make such covenants, we promise to honor them. For example, members of the Church covenant with the Lord at baptism and renew those covenants by partaking of the sacrament. We make further covenants in the temple. The Lord’s people are a covenant people. We are greatly blessed as we keep our covenants with the Lord. - **Endure to the End:** To remain true to the commandments of God despite temptation, opposition, and adversity throughout life. - **Eternal Life:** To live forever as families in God’s presence (see D&C 132:19–20). Eternal life is God's greatest gift to man. - **Gospel:** God’s plan of salvation, made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The gospel includes the eternal truths or laws, covenants, and ordinances needed for mankind to return to the presence of God. - **Grace:** The enabling power from Jesus Christ that allows us to obtain blessings in this life and to gain eternal life and exaltation after we have exercised faith, repented, and given our best effort to keep the commandments. Such divine help or strength is given through the mercy and love of Jesus Christ. We all need divine grace because of Adam’s Fall and also because of our weaknesses. - **Mercy:** The spirit of compassion, tenderness, and forgiveness. Mercy is one of the attributes of God. Jesus Christ offers mercy to us through His atoning sacrifice on conditions of repentance. - **Restitution:** The return of something that has been taken away or lost. For example, the Restoration of the goepel is called a restitution (see Acts 3:19–21). The word restoration also refers to the restoration of the body (see Alma 41:10–15). ### Other Terms That May Need Further Definition for Those You Teach (Page 84) - Clean from sin - Prayer - Temptation - Confession - Sacrament - Forgiveness - Strait and narrow path > Lesson Four # The Commandments: Preparing for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 85) There are many ways to teach the commandments found in this lesson. For example, you might teach a few of the commandments from this lesson as part of the first three lessons, or you might teach several commandments as a single lesson. What you do should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. ## Prepare to Teach (Page 85) Your purpose in teaching the commandments is to help people live the gospel by exercising faith in Jesus Christ and repenting as they prepare for baptism and confirmation. By obeying the commandments, people will grow in their testimony of the gospel, show that they have “broken hearts and contrite spirits,” and begin to repent of all their sins (see Moroni 6:1–4; D&C 20:37). This lesson is organized differently from the first three. The first three lessons explain the doctrinal foundation for the gospel of Jesus Christ. This lesson explains specific commandments God has given that help us apply gospel principles in our lives. There are many ways to teach this lesson. The approach you take should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. Constantly think and pray about how to help investigators live the gospel. Ideas include: - Teaching one or more commandments as part of the first three lessons. When doing so, consider the principle taught in Alma 12:32: “God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption” (italics added). Certain commandments, such as prayer and scripture study, might be taught best as part of the first three lessons. Other commandments might be best taught after you have laid the doctrinal foundation of the gospel found in the first three lessons. - Teaching two or three of the commandments as a single lesson. - Teaching a single commandment as a lesson. - Teaching the commandments in the context of the gospel. Briefly review the lesson on the gospel of Jesus Christ before teaching one or more of the commandments. As you do so, you can help investigators see how the commandments fit into the larger picture of exercising faith in the Savior and repenting in preparation for baptism and confirmation. Their lives can be blessed as they see the gospel of Jesus Christ as a pattern for living. You may be able to teach some investigators in a few visits; others may require more visits. You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find""]","According to the instructions on pages 84 and 243, missionaries can effectively support new converts and less-active members by focusing on building strong relationships with ward leaders and members, as well as providing personalized teaching on the commandments and gospel principles. They should participate actively in ward council meetings, assist members in their callings, and seek referrals from less-active members to help rebuild their faith. Teaching the 'Laws and Ordinances' lesson, as highlighted on page 236, helps prepare individuals for baptism and confirmation by emphasizing the importance of covenants, obedience, and enduring to the end. Additionally, studying scriptures such as 2 Nephi 31:18–20 and Alma 26:1–7, and sharing personal experiences like President Joseph F. Smith’s, reinforce the importance of maintaining the spirit of conversion and commitment. The guidance on pages 84 and 243 underscores that helping individuals understand the significance of the gift of the Holy Ghost, the role of commandments, and the process of repentance are essential steps in preparing them for these sacred ordinances, ultimately bringing souls closer to Christ and ensuring they are spiritually prepared for the covenants they will make.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How do we show respect 4 Heavenly Father and help others develop faith in Him?,"['<1-hop>\n\nto follow up in your next visit. ## Teach the Restored Gospel to Those without a Christian Background (Page 204) Some of the people whom you will teach may not believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ or have a Christian tradition. Many of these people, however, will have beliefs, practices, and places which they hold sacred. As a servant of God, it is essential that you show proper respect for their religious beliefs and traditions. Do not do anything that would show disrespect for that which is important to them. You may wonder how you should adjust your teaching approach to these people. It will be helpful to remember that in order to be converted, all of God’s children, regardless of background, must develop faith in Jesus Christ, repent, receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, and endure to the end by keeping the commandments and giving service. The principles that help others build faith in Jesus Christ are the same in all cultures. You can help people gain a correct understanding of God as our Heavenly Father and develop faith in Jesus Christ by helping them have personal spiritual experiences rather than simply telling them about the nature of God. For example, you will help people gain this understanding as they: - Gain a spiritual conviction that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. - Hear your sincere teaching and testimony of the gospel, including why you chose to follow Jesus Christ. - Frequently hear you and other members talk to Heavenly Father in a simple, heartfelt prayer. - Hear you bear powerful testimony. - Pray with you and on their own. - Come to learn how you feel about the scriptures as you read and discuss them. - Read God’s word from the scriptures daily (especially the Book of Mormon). - Attend church so they can see how we worship the Lord. - Meet members of the Church who can explain how they came to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. - Keep the commandments. These activities are beneficial for all people you teach, but they are essential when teaching those without a Christian background because these people are less likely to have had these experiences previously. Many converts from non-Christian backgrounds report that they did not understand much of what the missionaries were saying but that they felt the Spirit and wanted to do what the missionaries asked. You must do all you can to help investigators understand the doctrines of the gospel. Be patient and supportive, as it may take some time for people to learn to identify and express the feelings they have inside. You may need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching to help them understand. As you prepare to teach those without a Christian background, the following suggestions may help: - Provide simple overviews and reviews for each lesson. - Ask them to tell you what they understand and what they have experienced. - Take the time to define essential words and principles. Those you teach may not be familiar with many of the words you will use as you teach. - Return to a previously taught lesson to teach the doctrine more clearly. This may be necessary any time in the teaching process. #### Scriptural Examples (Page 206) The scriptures contain examples of missionaries who have taught those who did not believe in God or who misunderstood His true nature. Study the scriptures below, and then explain to your companion or record in your study journal how these missionaries helped people gain a testimony that God exists. - Alma and Amulek (Alma 9–12; 15) - Ammon and Aaron (Alma 17–22) - Alma (Alma 30) - Alma and others (Alma 31–35) - Paul (Acts 17:16–34) #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 206) When possible, identify a convert who was not part of a Christian tradition before meeting with the missionaries. Arrange to meet with him or her, and ask about his or her conversion experience. For example, you might ask what led the person to believe in God, the first time he or she prayed, the first time he or she felt an answer to prayer, the role of the scriptures in his or her conversion, and what it was like to attend Sunday services. Write what you learn in your study journal. #### Remember This (Page 206) - As people are taught the restored gospel and live it, their needs will be met. - Plan and study each day with your companion to be united and to teach with one voice. - Share your testimony frequently. - The scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, are your basic sources for teaching. - Pray for the gift of discernment to know when to use the skills described in this chapter. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 207) ### Personal Study (Page 206) - Assume you are placed in the following situations. How might you use the principles and skills in this chapter to help these people progress? Plan how you would apply them in each situation. - While walking through a park, you see a woman and a small boy sitting alone on a bench. The woman is crying. - You arrive at the home of investigators who have been preparing for baptism, and they tell you that they no longer want to meet with you. - You are meeting for the seventh time with an investigator who has been taught by several missionaries over a two-year period. There have been few if any signs of progress. - You are beginning to teach a member family a gospel message, and they say, “We have already asked everyone we know to meet with the missionaries, and they have all said no.” - Select one of the missionary lessons. Identify one or two scripture passages from each main principle. Practice teaching from those passages as outlined in the “Use the Scriptures” section of this', '<2-hop>\n\nway. That way is through the members of the Church. Whenever there is a member who introduces an investigator, there is an immediate support system. The member bears testimony of the truth of the work. He is anxious for the happiness of his investigator friend. He becomes excited as that friend makes progress in learning the gospel. “The full-time missionaries may do the actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up that teaching with the offering of his home to carry on this missionary service. He will bear sincere testimony of the divinity of the work. He will be there to answer questions when the missionaries are not around. He will be a friend to the convert who is making a big and often difficult change. . . . The process of bringing new people into the Church is not the responsibility alone of the missionaries. They succeed best when members become the source from which new investigators are found” (Ensign, May 1999, 105–6). The starting point in building strong relationships with members is the bishop. Offer to help and serve in any righteous way that he asks. Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing or a burden to the bishop?” Develop a “How can I help?” attitude. If you will look for opportunities to love, serve, and teach, the bishop and ward members will be more likely to trust you with their family members and friends. “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.” – THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH TEACHINGS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH, 113. Consider the following excerpt from a letter written by a missionary to his mission president: *Dear President, The assistants called today telling me I’m being transferred. I felt that I should write and thank you for sending me to this area. It seems like it was just yesterday that you were telling me about the challenges that lay ahead. Our first Sunday confirmed what you told me. We received a lukewarm welcome to the ward. The only ray of light that first Sunday was Scott, the new ward mission leader. He had been transferred to the Air Force base a month earlier and had been serving as ward mission leader for two weeks. Scott invited us to his home for dinner our first Sunday to discuss what could be done to get the work moving. After dinner, we knelt in prayer and asked Heavenly Father for His direction. As we prayed, we felt a sense of peace and determination. We determined that the best way to move the work forward was to gain the trust of the members. We decided to follow Ammon’s example and serve them. We started with the bishop. Because of the lack of baptisms in the area and the lack of effort from the previous missionaries, he was understandably less than excited at our request to meet with him. He eventually invited us over to his home for dinner. We learned that the bishop was preparing to remove the carpet from his living room and restore the hardwood floor found underneath. We volunteered our help and he accepted. At the conclusion of the project, the bishop asked us to speak in a sacrament meeting. We took this as evidence that he was beginning to trust us. We followed this same pattern of service as we met with other members. We found opportunities to help them in a variety of simple ways. When we were not with the members, we were knocking on doors and talking to as many people as we could about the restored gospel. We were blessed with people to teach, and the members saw us bringing people to church whom we were finding on our own. The attitude of the whole ward began to change. There was an increasing excitement about missionary work. Once the members trusted us, the work hastened. Many baptisms followed.* Many members of the Church have fears about doing missionary work. Many are unsure where to begin or what to say. Many fear that they will lose close friends if they try to share the gospel with them. There are many ways to help the members. For example, help build their faith by teaching them the message of the Restoration and other doctrines of the lessons. Help them feel the Spirit and power of our message. Strengthening their understanding of the doctrine of Christ will do more to increase their trust in you and to build their excitement to do missionary work than anything else you can do. Help them understand that offering the restored gospel will flow more naturally out of relationships where they are seeking to love and serve their family members and friends. Teach them the principles from the “Go About Doing Good” section of this chapter. Encourage members to “join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who [know] not God” (Alma 6:6). In all you do with members, seek to lift and build their faith to help them do missionary work. In addition to working with active members, seek to find people to teach through prospective elders, less-active members, and new members. These members are likely to have many friends of other faiths and be blessed as they share the restored gospel with their family members and friends. In every visit with members, do all you can to encourage them to: - Pray and follow the Spirit. - Give service. - Develop friendships. - Open their mouths to share the restored gospel. - Invite others to do things to increase their faith in Christ. Every referral you receive from a member should be treated as something precious. When a member gives you the name of a friend to call or visit, respond quickly and report the results back to the member. #### Ideas for Helping Members (Page 176) There are many ways to encourage members to become more']","Based on the context, to show respect 4 Heavenly Father and help others develop faith in Him, it is essential to be patient, supportive, and culturally sensitive when teaching those without a Christian background. This includes providing simple overviews, asking them to share their understanding, defining essential words, and returning to previous lessons if needed. Additionally, demonstrating sincere prayer, bearing powerful testimony, and encouraging personal spiritual experiences—such as praying, reading scriptures, and attending church—are vital. Building trust through service and love, especially by supporting members and community relationships, also helps others develop faith in Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life.

Jesus Christ is central to that plan. – God’s plan of happiness makes it possible to return to His presence (see Moses 1:39). – Our eternal progression depends on how we use our agency (see 2 Nephi 2:27–29). - The Creation – Under the Father’s direction, Jesus Christ created the earth (see Hebrews 1:1–3). - Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve – Adam and Eve were created in God’s image (see Genesis 1:26–27). – In the Garden of Eden they were innocent and lived in God’s presence. – Because they partook of the forbidden fruit, they were cast out of the garden (see Moses 4:19–31). This is called the Fall. – They became mortal, were able to have children, and were also subject to sin and death (see 2 Nephi 2:22–25; Moses 5:11). - Our Life on Earth – Our purpose in life is to find lasting peace, joy, and happiness as families and to prepare to return to live with God. – We came to the earth to be tested (see Abraham 3:24–25). – We gain a body of flesh and bones, but we are subject to physical death. – God gives commandments. If we obey, we are blessed. If we disobey, we sin and receive the consequences. – All sin must be paid for, either by ourselves or by Christ (see D&C 19:15–20). – We make choices, and we all commit sin (see Romans 3:23). – We have experiences that bring us happiness and also sorrow. – We cannot overcome either physical or spiritual death without Christ. - The Atonement – Because Jesus Christ overcame physical death, we will all be resurrected (see Alma 11:41–43). – Through Christ’s Atonement we can become clean from sin so that we can return to live in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 9:8–9). – Christ will forgive our sins as we have faith in Him, repent, receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. - The Spirit World – All people must die. – At death our spirits go to the spirit world. – We live in either a state of misery or a state of peace and rest, depending on how we lived in this life. - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality – Our spirits and bodies will be reunited in the resurrection (see Alma 11:42–45; 40:23). – We will return to God’s presence to be judged according to our works and desires. – If we have repented, we will receive mercy. – Eternal life is a gift of God given to those who fully obey the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 14:7). - Kingdoms of Glory (see D&C 76; 137; 1 Corinthians 15:40–42). – We receive rewards according to our works and desires (see D&C 137:9). – Those who receive the gospel and live it valiantly throughout their lives will receive the celestial kingdom (see D&C 76:50–70). – Honorable people who are “blinded by the craftiness of men” and who are “not valiant in the testimony of Jesus [Christ]” receive the terrestrial kingdom (see D&C 76:75, 79). – Those who sin and do not repent will receive the telestial glory after they suffer and pay for their sins. **Commitments** - Will you pray to know that what we have taught is true? - Will you repent of your sins? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","The <1-hop> segment lists scriptures related to baptism and the Holy Ghost, emphasizing the importance of being baptized and receiving the Holy Ghost to start a new spiritual life.

"How does the theme of Adam, as revealed in the early teachings and the Fall, connect to the restoration of true doctrines through the prophet Joseph Smith, as emphasized in the context of gospel outreach and family strengthening?","['<1-hop>\n\nFrom the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ## Addressing the Importance of the Family (Page 173) The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity. Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following: *There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity. Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.* You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration: *The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrines and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about . . .* The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world. ## The Importance of Members (Page 174) Work with members of the Church to find people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to investigate the restored gospel. This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and less-active members, recent converts, and part-member families. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting.

It emphasizes that despite humanity's repeated rejection of the gospel, God has continued to reach out through prophets like Adam and later through Joseph Smith, who restored true doctrines and ordinances. This restoration, documented in the Book of Mormon, is central to strengthening families and sharing the gospel.

Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance. Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast. In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time. > 2.7 ## Service in the Community You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17).

You have been called by revelation through God’s chosen servants to assist the Apostles in this great work of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world in order to make disciples of all nations. When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6). To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you. Heavenly Father loves you, and He will help you to love and bless His children wherever you serve. He will empower you and the people you serve, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to be truly “converted unto the Lord” (Alma 23:6). These missionary standards are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They will help protect you physically, spiritually, and emotionally and help you be the disciple Jesus Christ needs you to become. If you have questions about a standard, prayerfully ask the Lord to help you understand its importance, and then if needed, ask your companion, your young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders for help. Regularly study these standards with your companion and strive to obey them. We congratulate you for accepting a call to serve a full-time mission, and we pray you will find true peace and joy in serving the Lord Jesus Christ. First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints # should serve with a sincere desire to help others without any expected outcomes.

how Jacob teach prophets and why Jacob important for prophets,"['<1-hop>\n\nto man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation. They in turn teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer. The teachings of prophets are found in sacred books called scriptures. Our Father’s plan for us to be successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus’ Atonement at the center of that plan. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can receive eternal life if we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. “This is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:21). All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to accept or reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles. Those who choose to obey are blessed, but those who ignore, reject, or distort the gospel do not receive God’s promised blessings. Whenever people choose to disregard, disobey, or distort any gospel principle or ordinance, whenever they reject the Lord’s prophets, or whenever they fail to endure in faith, they distance themselves from God and begin to live in spiritual darkness. Eventually this leads to a condition called apostasy. When widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority to teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel. Biblical history has recorded many instances of God speaking to prophets, and it also tells of many instances of apostasy. To end each period of general apostasy, God has shown His love for His children by calling another prophet and giving him priesthood authority to restore and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ anew. In essence, the prophet acts as a steward to oversee the household of God here on earth. Such periods of time headed by prophetic responsibility are called dispensations. God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to Adam and gave him priesthood authority. Adam was the first prophet on the earth. By revelation, Adam learned of mankind’s proper relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Adam and Eve taught their children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel in all aspects of their lives. Adam was followed by other prophets, but over time the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel and fell into apostasy, choosing to be unrighteous. Thus began the pattern of prophetic dispensations that makes up much of the recorded history of the Old Testament. Heavenly Father revealed His gospel through direct communication to prophets such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Each prophet was called by God to begin a new dispensation of the gospel. To each of these prophets God granted priesthood authority and revealed eternal truths. Unfortunately, in each dispensation people eventually used their agency to choose to reject the gospel and then fell into apostasy. ### Prophets (Page 48) Determine what the person you are teaching understands about prophets. In most cultures there are people who believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God as defined in the restored gospel. Explain clearly that God establishes His kingdom on the earth by calling a prophet to establish a new dispensation. He gives that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. You might wonder how gospel dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people understand that God loves His children and that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. #### Scripture Study (Page 48) Study about Prophets using the following scriptures: - Jacob 4:4, 6, Mosiah 8:13–18, Acts 10:34–43, and Amos 3:7 Study about Dispensations using the following scriptures: - D&C 136:36–38, Moses 5:4–12, 55–59, Moses 8:19–30, Bible Dictionary, “Dispensations” > Lesson One: Fourth Principle ## The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement (Page 48) A few hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ, people again fell into apostasy. But when the Savior began His mortal ministry He established His Church again on the earth. Heavenly Father sent His Son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son . . . that the world through him might be saved” (John 3:16–17). Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take upon Him, by His suffering, the sins of all who would live on this earth and to overcome physical death. The Savior made an infinite atoning sacrifice so that if we have faith in Him, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end, we can receive forgiveness of our sins and enter and follow the path that will lead us to eternal life in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 31:13–21). During His earthly ministry, the Savior taught His gospel and performed many miracles. He called twelve men to be His Apostles and laid His hands on their heads to give them priest- hood authority. He organized His Church, fulfilled prophecy, and was rejected and crucified. Most important, He completed the Atonement. The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, completed all that His Heavenly Father sent Him to do. Before the Savior’s death and Resurrection, He gave His Apostles authority to teach His gospel, perform the ordinances of', '<2-hop>\n\nrighteousness and our guilt. If we have repented, we will receive mercy. We will be rewarded according to our works and our desires. Through the resurrection all people will become immortal—they will live forever. Immortality is a free gift to all people, whether they are righteous or wicked. Eternal life is not, however, the same as immortality. Eternal life is a gift of God given only to those who obey His gospel. It is the highest state that we can achieve. It comes to those who are freed from sin and suffering through the Atonement of Christ. It is exaltation, which means living with God forever in eternal families. It is to know God and Jesus Christ and to experience the life they enjoy. ### Resurrection and Reincarnation (Page 67) Some people may confuse the doctrine of resurrection with the concept of reincarnation. The concept of reincarnation involves being born into the world again in a different form and is false doctrine. The doctrine of resurrection involves receiving an eternal reward of an immortal body of flesh and bone. This is true doctrine. Make sure those you teach understand clearly the doctrine of the resurrection. > Lesson Two: Eighth Principle ## Kingdoms of Glory (Page 67) During our mortal lives we make choices regarding good and evil. God rewards us according to our works and desires. Because God rewards everyone according to deeds done in the body, there are different kingdoms of glory to which we may be assigned after the Judgment. Those who have repented of their sins and received the ordinances of the gospel and kept the associated covenants will be cleansed by the Atonement of Christ. They will receive exaltation in the highest kingdom, also known as the celestial kingdom. They will live in God’s presence, become like Him, and receive a fulness of joy. They will live together for eternity with those of their family who qualify. In the scriptures this kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun. People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars. #### Scripture Study (Page 68) - Resurrection and Restoration: 2 Nephi 9:14–15, Jacob 6:8–9,Alma 42:13–15, 22–23 - Judgment: 2 Nephi 28:23, Mosiah 3:23–25, Alma 5:15–21, Alma 12:12–14, D&C 132:12; 137:9 John 5:22 - Kingdoms of Glory: 3 Nephi 28:10, D&C 76: Introduction, D&C 76, D&C 137, Matthew 5:48, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40 - Eternal Life: 2 Nephi 31:17–21, D&C 14:7, D&C 29:43–44, D&C 45:8, D&C 93:19, John 3:16, John 17:3 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 68) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

"How does Helaman show diligence and obedience in Helaman 1 and 2, and why is that important for missionary work?","['<1-hop>\n\n135) Diligence is steady, consistent, earnest, and energetic effort in doing the Lord’s work. The Lord expects you to work diligently—persistently and with great effort and care. A diligent missionary works effectively and efficiently. Diligence in missionary work is an expression of your love for the Lord and His work. When you are diligent, you find joy and satisfaction in your work. Do many good things of your own free will (see D&C 58:27). Don’t wait for your leaders to tell you what to do. Continue until you have done all you can, even when you are tired. Focus on the most important things and avoid wasting time. Pray for guidance and strength. Plan regularly and effectively. Avoid anything that distracts your thoughts or actions. “I have often said one of the greatest secrets of missionary work is work! If a missionary works, he will get the Spirit; if he gets the Spirit, he will teach by the Spirit; and if he teaches by the Spirit, he will touch the hearts of the people and he will be happy. There will be no homesickness, no worrying about families, for all time and talents and interests are centered on the work of the ministry.

Obedience is the first law of heaven. It is an act of faith. You may sometimes be required to do things you do not completely understand. As you obey, you increase in faith, knowledge, wisdom, testimony, protection, and freedom. Strive to be obedient to the Lord, the living prophet, and your mission president. “The discipline contained in daily obedience and clean living and wholesome lives builds an armor around you of protection and safety from the temptations that beset you as you proceed through mortality.” – ELDER L.

We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper. Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son. Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions. In addition, we should continually improve—to develop Christlike qualities, to grow in knowledge, and to serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior expects of us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily. #### Scripture Study (Page 77) - We All Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:7–8 - Repentance: Alma 34:8–17, D&C 58:42–43, D&C 61:2, 2 Corinthians 7:9–10, Bible Dictionary, “Repentance” - Redemption and Forgiveness: Helaman 5:10–11 - Mercy Claims the Penitent: Alma 12:32–35, Alma 42:13, 21–24, D&C 18:10–13 > Lesson Three: Fourth Principle ## Baptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. #### Before Baptism (Page 78) “Ensure that [investigators] have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. Investigators should live the principles of moral worthiness, the Word of Wisdom, and commit to pay tithing. If missionaries feel additional preparation is needed, they should postpone baptism until the investigator meets the standard. *“Before baptism each investigator should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch president, and attend several sacrament meetings”* (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). #### Scripture Study (Page 79) - Christ’s Example: 2 Nephi 31:4–18, Matthew 3:13–17 - The Baptismal Covenant: Mosiah 5:8–10, Mosiah 18:8–10, D&C 20:37 - Qualifications']","In Helaman 1 and 2, Helaman exemplifies diligence by persistently working to build faith and lead his people, and obedience by following God's commandments and the counsel of his leaders.

"How does the guidance in the Doctrine and Covenants inform missionaries' obedience and standards during their service, and how do these principles support their lifelong commitment to following God's commandments as emphasized in the missionary organization and activities?","['<1-hop>\n\nYour Full-Time Missionary Experience > 1.0 ## Introduction Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience. When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22). Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ. > 1.1 ## Obedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ## Mission Leadership Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6). > 2.1.1 ### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy. Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9). You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you. > 2.1.2 ### Mission Presidency Your mission president presides in the mission', '<2-hop>\n\n# Message from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Dear Fellow Missionary: After His Resurrection, Jesus Christ appeared to His disciples and commanded them to “make disciples of” (see Matthew 28:19, footnote a) “all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19–20).

When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6). To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you. Heavenly Father loves you, and He will help you to love and bless His children wherever you serve. He will empower you and the people you serve, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to be truly “converted unto the Lord” (Alma 23:6). These missionary standards are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They will help protect you physically, spiritually, and emotionally and help you be the disciple Jesus Christ needs you to become. If you have questions about a standard, prayerfully ask the Lord to help you understand its importance, and then if needed, ask your companion, your young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders for help. Regularly study these standards with your companion and strive to obey them. We congratulate you for accepting a call to serve a full-time mission, and we pray you will find true peace and joy in serving the Lord Jesus Christ. First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints # should serve with a sincere desire to help others without any expected outcomes. Follow all service project rules (see 7.2), especially any about not teaching while serving and not serving where you would be alone with children. If someone expresses interest in your message, reply very briefly and arrange to meet with them at a different time and location to share a message. For more information see section 7.2, “Guidelines for Service.” #']","The guidance in the Doctrine and Covenants emphasizes the importance of obedience and dedication to God's commandments, instructing missionaries to keep His commandments with joy and to live according to the standards outlined in their mission. It highlights that being faithful and obedient is essential for safety, spiritual growth, and fulfilling their purpose of bringing souls unto Christ. These principles are reinforced by the standards for life, which encourage missionaries to dedicate themselves fully to God through personal study, goal setting, and righteous use of technology, ensuring that their service aligns with lifelong commitments to follow God's commandments. Together, these teachings support missionaries in maintaining a lifelong, obedient discipleship rooted in the doctrines of the church, enabling them to serve effectively and grow spiritually throughout their lives.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does Romans 1:16 relate to the importance of teaching by the Spirit as described in the missionary training context?,"['<1-hop>\n\nactivities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ## The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power?

He came into the world to do His Father’s will,', '<2-hop>\n\n### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 70) - Pre-Earth Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us - God is our Heavenly Father, and we are His children (see Acts 17:16–34; Hebrews 12:9). – God has a plan for our happiness.

"How Christ make salvation possible for everyone, and how people accept Christ in the spirit world?","['<1-hop>\n\nmakes salvation possible for everyone who did not have the opportunity to receive, understand, and obey the gospel during their mortal lives. The gospel is preached to these deceased people in the spirit world. Members of the Church on earth perform the saving ordinances in behalf of their deceased ancestors and others. Deceased persons living in the spirit world have the opportunity to accept or reject the gospel and the ordinances performed in their behalf. For this reason, Church members search for information about their ancestors. They complete pedigree charts and family group records and submit the names of deceased relatives who need to have saving ordinances performed on their behalf in sacred temples. This is family history work. Worthy members ages 12 and over, including new members, may receive from their bishop a recommend to perform baptisms for the dead. #### Family History (Page 100) Invite new members to meet with a member or go to a local family history center (where available) for an introduction to family history work and to the resources available to them. Provide them with a copy of family history materials. #### Scripture Study (Page 100) - D&C 43:16, D&C 128, D&C 138, 1 Peter 3:18-21 - D&C 95:8-9, D&C 131, Psalm 65:4, 1 Corinthians 15:29 - D&C 124:22-42, D&C 132, Brochure, Welcome to the Family History Center #### Commitments (Page 100) - Will you prepare to receive temple ordinances?

When we give loving service to others, we are serving God. When we are baptized, we covenant to give such service (see Mosiah 18:8–10). We are to become aware of others’ physical and spiritual needs. We then give of our time, talents, and means to help meet those needs. We follow the example of the Savior, who came to serve others. We are to do what Jesus did and become like Him. Soon after baptism new members receive from priesthood leaders the blessing of a responsibility to help in the Church. This is referred to as a calling. All of the work in the Church is voluntary. No one is paid for such service. When we accept callings, we are sustained publicly in a Church meeting so that other members can acknowledge our calling and provide support. We are also set apart by a priesthood leader and given special blessings to help us fulfill our callings. The Church needs the talents and abilities of every member to fill a wide variety of callings. All callings are important and help build God’s kingdom. We are to accept such callings and work diligently to learn and fulfill our duties. As we do so, we grow in faith, develop new talents and a greater ability to serve, and receive numerous other blessings. Priesthood holders may be called as home teachers. Home teachers make at least monthly visits to the homes of assigned member families. They teach the gospel, support parents, nurture friendships, and help families prepare to receive and keep temple covenants. Visiting teachers represent the Relief Society by making monthly visits to each adult sister as assigned. #### Scripture Study (Page 101) **Charity:** - Moroni 7:43-48, D&C 88:125, Matthew 22:36-40, 1 Corinthians 13:1-8 **Care for the Poor:** - Mosiah 4:26, Alma 34:28-29, D&C 52:40, Matthew 25:40 **We Are to Serve:** - Mosiah 2:17, Mosiah 18:8-10, D&C 42:29, D&C 107:99-100 #### Commitments (Page 101) - Will you accept and fulfill the duties of a calling (including an assignment as a home teacher or visiting teacher)? - Will you support others in their callings? ### Teaching and Learning in the Church (Page 102) The Church is organized to perfect and bless the lives of the members. It gives us opportunities to teach one another the gospel, fellowship and serve one another, and support one another in our quest for salvation. In the family and through the Church, each member is taught the doctrines of the gospel. When members are called to teaching assignments, they are provided materials and help to enable them to succeed. #### Scripture Study (Page 102) - D&C 88:77–79, Ephesians 4:11–14 #### Commitment (Page 102) - Will you attend church? ### Endure to the End (Page 102) As we continue to live the gospel, we grow closer to our Heavenly Father. We enjoy and appreciate more the Atonement of the Savior. Our families are drawn closer together. We experience greater feelings of the love, joy, and peace that come from the Atonement. Our hearts are changed, and we find security in living the restored gospel. As we continue to exercise faith in Christ, repent, and renew our covenants, we enjoy continued guidance from the Holy Ghost. If we endure to the end of our lives in being true to our covenants, we will receive eternal life. A few members do not endure or remain fully active. However, enduring to the end is a personal responsibility. We “work out [our] own salvation” (Philippians 2:12), and we serve and love those whose faith has grown weak through inactivity. #### Scripture Study (Page 102) - 2 Nephi 31:20–21, Moroni 6:4, D&C 20:37, Articles of Faith 1:3 - John 14:15, 21, Ephesians 4:11–14, Philippians 2:12 #### Commitment (Page 102) - Will you continue to live the gospel by keeping baptismal covenants throughout your life? > Beginning of Chapter 4 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?

By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. #### Scripture Study (Page 20) What is the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ? - Read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27:13–22 for answers to the question.']","Christ made salvation possible for everyone who did not have the opportunity to receive, understand, and obey the gospel during their mortal lives by His Atonement and Resurrection.

Hwo do the Spirit and the message of the Restoratn of the gospel of Jesus Christ work togther to help investigators keep commitments and prepare for baptizm?,"['<1-hop>\n\nthe message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital. There may be times when you call the investigators to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment. Help investigators identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message. Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments. Investigators are changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are with them. Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 215) - Write in your daily planner your plans for daily contact with each investigator. Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with investigators. - Choose one commitment invitation you will extend when you teach the lessons. Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment. Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns. #### Remember This (Page 215) - Focus on inviting people to make commitments in every finding or teaching situation, both with those who are not members of the Church and with Church members. - Extend commitment invitations to help people experience conversion. - Promise blessings. - Bear testimony. - Follow through to help people keep commitments. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 216) ### Personal Study (Page 216) - Identify a commandment listed in either lesson 4 or 5. Think of the blessings you have received from obeying this commandment, and write them in your journal. - In a letter, ask your family members how they have been blessed by obeying a specific commandment (for example, tithing). - Write how you feel about extending commitments. Are you bold or timid? Are you confident that people will be blessed, or do you have doubts? Are you consistent, patient, and helpful as you make daily contact? Do the people know you love them? How can you correct any weakness you identify in your invitations? - Review your lesson plans for each lesson. Do you include specific commitments? Does your lesson plan lead clearly to commitments? ### Companion Study (Page 216) - From your daily planner, make a list of people you have contacted in the past two days, including investigators and members. For each person, write the commitment(s) they made and other invitations you could have or should have extended. Discuss why you were able to obtain commitments from some of these people and what prevented you from obtaining commitments from others. What will you do to follow up on these commitments? - Look at your daily planner, and write the names of specific investigators you will teach in the next day or two. Consider which commandment(s) listed in lessons 4 and 5 you will invite them to live. Discuss how you will extend the commitment and the specific blessings you will promise for obedience. - Consider showing the Teaching Record to investigators to let them know what will be expected. If appropriate, share a copy with them. - Review the Notes/To Do List in your planner for the past three days to see if you have written your assignments to follow up on every invitation you have extended. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 216) - Discuss effective and creative ideas for daily contact with investigators. How have missionaries worked with members effectively? What printed or audiovisual materials are useful? What can you do when people are not home or are too busy to see you? - Discuss ways that missionaries have effectively taught the commandments in lessons 4 and 5. - Discuss specific concerns of some current investigators. What are the nature of these concerns? What can the missionaries do to resolve the concerns? ### Mission President (Page 216) - Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach. Help them focus on helping people make and keep commitments. - Encourage priesthood leaders and members to actively participate in making daily contact with investigators. - Be an example of extending invitations in your missionary efforts and with the missionaries you serve. > Beginning of chapter 12 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation? (Page 217) #### Consider This (Page 217) - What do I need to do to help prepare people for baptism and confirmation? - How do I conduct an effective baptismal interview? - How is a spiritual baptismal service planned and conducted? - How do I work closely with the bishop to ensure that converts are confirmed? - Why is it important to complete baptismal and confirmation records? ## Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 217) The purpose of your teaching is to help others develop faith in Jesus Christ and repent of their sins. As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (Moroni 8:25). The baptismal interview is the way established by the Church to ensure that each candidate meets the Lord’s standards for baptism and is prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Through this interview, baptismal candidates fulfill the scriptural requirement that they witness before an authorized representative of the Church that they have “truly repented of all their sins” (D&C 20:37). The commitments that investigators make prepare them to make and keep the covenant of baptism. People who have kept the commitments that you invited them to make will be well prepared for the interview and for membership and activity in the Church. As you teach investigators and prepare them for baptism and confirmation, make sure that they meet the qualifications for baptism. #### Qualifications for Baptism (Page 218) 1. **Doctrine and Covenants 20:37:**', '<2-hop>\n\nthe baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). #### Defining Words (Page 35) We have a powerful message with a unique vocabulary. Just as a physician speaks differently in the family waiting room than in the operating room, so too must you learn to speak so that those who are unfamiliar with our message can understand what you are teaching. To prepare to help others understand unfamiliar words, study the list of key']","The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ emphasizes the vital influence of the Spirit, which testifies of the truthfulness of the message. As missionaries call investigators to keep commitments, the Spirit helps them recognize the blessings received and feel the truth of the message. Encouraging investigators to describe their feelings as the Spirit testifies strengthens their faith. By helping them identify blessings from obedience and inviting them to make and keep commitments, the Spirit works through these teachings to prepare investigators for baptism. The combination of the message and the Spirit's testimony guides investigators to develop faith, repent, and meet the standards necessary for baptism and confirmation.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does the Bible help missionaries understand the importance of the Book of Mormon in answering great questions of the soul?,"['<1-hop>\n\n31:5–9). As you use the Book of Mormon and the Bible as companion volumes of scripture, they will overcome contention and correct false doctrine (see 2 Nephi 3:12). The Bible teaches the following about the law of witnesses: “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” (2 Corinthians 13:1). In harmony with this law, both the Book of Mormon and the Bible testify of Jesus Christ. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 120) Find cross-references on the following topics in the Book of Mormon and Bible. Examples are given in parentheses after each topic. Add passages and topics of your own. - Prophets (Amos 3:7 and Jacob 4:4–6) - Apostasy (2 Timothy 4:3–4 and 2 Nephi 28) - Restoration (Acts 3:19–21 and 1 Nephi 13:34–42) - Children of God (Acts 17:29 and 1 Nephi 17:36) #### Scripture Study (Page 120) - What does the Bible say about the Book of Mormon? - John 10:16, Isaiah 29:4, 11–18, Ezekiel 37:15–17, Bible Dictionary, “Ephraim, Stick of” - What does the Book of Mormon say about the Bible? -1 Nephi 13:20–29, 40–41, 2 Nephi 29:3–14, 3 Nephi 23:1, Mormon 7:8–9 - In what ways do both books serve as testaments of Christ? - 2 Nephi 29:8, John 20:31, Acts 10:43 ## The Book of Mormon Answers Questions of the Soul (Page 121) President Ezra Taft Benson said that missionaries “need to show how [the Book of Mormon] answers the great questions of the soul” (“Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, Nov. 1988, 5). “The great questions of the soul” may include such questions as these: Is there really a God? Did I exist before I was born? Will I live after I die? What is the purpose of life? Is Jesus really the Savior? Other questions may focus on more temporal needs: How can I improve my relationship with my spouse? How can I help my teenagers avoid drugs or immorality? How can I find work to support my family? The gospel of Jesus Christ helps us answer both kinds of questions. As we gain faith that the Book of Mormon is true, we can begin to answer questions about the purpose of life and the hope of eternal life. The Book of Mormon describes the plan of happiness, which gives meaning and perspective to life. Answers to questions such as the following are clearly taught in the Book of Mormon. - Is there a God? (Alma 22) - What does Jesus Christ expect of me? (2 Nephi 9) - How can a belief in Jesus Christ help me? (Alma 36) - Is there life after death? (Alma 40) - What is the purpose of life? (Alma 34) - Why does God allow evil and suffering to occur? (2 Nephi 2; Alma 14:9–11; 60:13) - Does my infant need to be baptized? (Moroni 8) - Does God know me? (Alma 5:38, 58) - Does God answer prayers? (Enos 1) - How can I find peace and joy? (Mosiah 2, 4) - How can my family be happier and more united? (Mosiah 2) - How can I balance my family and career? (3 Nephi 13) - How can I strengthen my relationship with my spouse? (3 Nephi 14) - How can I avoid the evils that threaten my family? (Alma 39) - How can I avoid sin? (Helaman 5) As we read the Book of Mormon with the guidance of the Spirit, it helps us answer personal questions. It teaches that prayer and revelation are the key to solving particular problems. It helps us have faith that God will answer our prayers. The Book of Mormon also helps us understand that God’s commandments are not a restrictive list of dos and don’ts but guideposts to a happy, abundant life. As we begin to understand that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are the way to the abundant life, we will appreciate that these principles help answer any question and fill any need. For example, we understand that repentance, forgiveness, and the covenant to serve others are essential in improving relationships with our spouses. We see that faith in Christ, accepting and keeping covenants, and following the promptings of the Spirit can help teenagers avoid the powerful temptations that surround them. The gospel can resolve almost any question or need. This is why you are to “teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel” (D&C 42:12). “In a world ever more dangerous . . . the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ has the nourishing power to heal starving spirits of the world. – PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER “THE BOOK OF MORMON: ANOTHER TESTAMENT OF JESUS CHRIST,” ENSIGN, NOV. 2001, 64 #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 122) Make a list of some “great questions of the soul” that investigators have asked. Find verses in the Book of Mormon to answer these questions. Write the answers in your study journal, and use them as you teach. ## The Book of Mormon Draws People Nearer to God (Page 122) Regarding the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). The Book of Mormon is a springboard to testimony and personal revelation. Use the Book of Mormon to help people have spiritual experiences, especially a witness from the Holy Ghost that the book itself is true. By consistently inviting people to live the principles found in the Book of Mormon, you help them develop faith in Jesus Christ and draw nearer to God. President Gordon B. Hinckley declared: “Those who have read [the Book of Mormon] prayerfully, be they rich or poor, learned or unlearned, have grown under its power. . . . Without reservation I promise you that if you will', '<2-hop>\n\n(Ephesians 4:5). Joseph attended different churches, but he remained confused about which church he should join. He later wrote: *“So great were the confusions and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was . . . to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. . . . In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10).* As Joseph sought truth among the different faiths, he turned to the Bible for guidance. He read, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (James 1:5). Because of this passage, Joseph decided to ask God what he should do. In the spring of 1820 he went to a nearby grove of trees and knelt in prayer. He described his experience: *“I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. . . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17).* In this vision God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith. The Savior told Joseph not to join any of the churches, for they “were all wrong” and “all their creeds were an abomination.” He stated, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof” (Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Even though many good people believed in Christ and tried to understand and teach His gospel, they did not have the fulness of truth or the priesthood authority to baptize and perform other saving ordinances. They had inherited a state of apostasy as each generation was influenced by what the previous one passed on, including changes in the doctrines and in ordinances such as baptism. As God had done with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to the earth. After the appearance of the Father and the Son, other heavenly messengers, or angels were sent to Joseph Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery. John the Baptist appeared and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, which includes the authority to perform the ordinance of baptism. Peter, James, and John (three of Christ’s original Apostles) appeared and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, restoring the same authority given to Christ’s Apostles anciently. With this priesthood authority, Joseph Smith was directed to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth. Through him, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles. The time in which we live is referred to by Bible prophets as the last days, the latter days, or the dispensation of the fulness of times. It is the period of time just before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It is the final dispensation. This is why the Church is named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A living prophet directs the Church today. This prophet, the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is the authorized successor to Joseph Smith. He and the present Apostles trace their authority to Jesus Christ in an unbroken chain of ordinations through Joseph Smith. ### Memorize Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17 (Page 52) Memorize Joseph Smith’s description of seeing the Father and the Son (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17), and always be ready to describe the First Vision using his own words. Do not rush through it. Bear sincere testimony that you know it is true. Do not hesitate to explain how you came to know of its truth. Invite your companion to do so as well. ### Bear Testimony (Page 52) An important part of a missionary’s duty is to bear testimony of the current prophet and president of the Church. #### Scripture Study (page 52) Study 2 Nephi 3, D&C 112:30, Ephesians 1:10, Ephesians 4:5, James 1:5, and Brochure, The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith > Lesson One: Seventh Principle ## The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Page 52) Knowing that doubt, disbelief, and misinformation would remain after centuries of darkness, our loving Heavenly Father brought forth an ancient volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible, which contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. This volume of holy scripture provides convincing evidence that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God. This record is the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where gold plates had lain hidden for centuries. These gold plates contained the writings of prophets giving an account of God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Joseph Smith translated the contents of these plates by the power of God. The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of the Savior and taught His gospel. After His Resurrection, Christ appeared to these people. He taught them His gospel and established His Church. The Book of Mormon proves that “God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old” (D&C 20:11). In order to know that the Book of Mormon is true, a person must read, ponder,']","The Bible teaches principles such as the law of witnesses (2 Corinthians 13:1), which underscores the importance of having multiple testimonies like the Book of Mormon. The context shows that missionaries use both scriptures to address questions about God, Jesus Christ, and salvation, helping individuals find answers to profound questions about life, purpose, and faith. By studying both the Bible and the Book of Mormon, missionaries can better guide others in understanding the fulness of the gospel and how these scriptures testify of Christ, thus drawing people nearer to God.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does 1 Nephi 8:12 relate to the love and concern God shows from the beginning of the world, and how can this help missionaries teach about the importance of the gospel and families?","['<1-hop>\n\nfor Baptism: 2 Nephi 9:23, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 7:14–15, 3 Nephi 11:23–27, Moroni 6:1–4, D&C 20:37, Acts 2:37–39 - The Lord Institutes the Sacrament: 3 Nephi 18:1–18, Luke 22:15–20 - Promised Blessings of Baptism: Mosiah 4:11–12, 26, Moroni 8:25–26, John 3:5, Romans 6:4 - The Sacrament Prayers: Moroni 4 and 5, D&C 20:75–79 - Partaking of the Sacrament: D&C 27:2, 1 Corinthians 11:23–29 - Necessity for Authority: D&C 22, Hebrews 5:4 > Lesson Three: Fifth Principle ## The Gift of the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ## Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and', '<2-hop>\n\nFrom the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ## Addressing the Importance of the Family (Page 173) The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity. Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following: *There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity. Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.* You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration: *The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrines and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about . . .* The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world. ## The Importance of Members (Page 174) Work with members of the Church to find people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to investigate the restored gospel. This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and less-active members, recent converts, and part-member families. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting. Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better']","1 Nephi 8:12 describes the love of the tree of life, symbolizing God's concern and love for His children from the beginning of the world. This relates to the broader pattern of God's love and concern revealed through prophets and His efforts to guide His children back to Him. For missionaries, understanding this connection helps teach that God's love is eternal and centered in families and the gospel. By sharing how God's love has been demonstrated through His concern from the start, missionaries can help others see the importance of the restored gospel and the eternal nature of families, encouraging them to seek the blessings of the gospel to strengthen their family relationships and return to God's presence.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints use the Book of Mormon to strengthen faith and respond to objections, and why is bearing testimony important in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\nprayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts . . . the Spirit of the Lord. There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“The Power of the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, June 1988, 6). ## Use the Book of Mormon to Respond to Objections (Page 122) Many people will not believe everything you teach. President Ezra Taft Benson taught how the Book of Mormon can be the central resource in responding to such situations: “We are to use the Book of Mormon in handling objections to the Church. . . . “. . . All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. . . . The only problem the objector has to resolve forhimself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation. “Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively. We are not obligated to answer every objection. Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand” (A Witness and a Warning, 4–5). For example, sincere investigators might object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom. Help them see that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation. You might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.” Investigators must resolve for themselves their concerns and objections. You can help as you focus them on what will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. When they strengthen their testimony of the Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections and concerns. As you answer concerns, remember that our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his successors—who receive direct revelation from God. There- fore, the first question for an investigator to answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. #### Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon (Page 123) One way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 123) In your study journal, write down how you would refer to Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon to respond to the following objections or concerns: - “I don’t believe that God speaks to people anymore.” - “I believe that I can worship God in my own way rather than through some organized religion.” - “Why must I give up drinking wine with my meals if I join your church?” - “Why do I need religion?”', '<2-hop>\n\nthis principle help people gain faith and testimony? - How will this commitment help people repent and be more sensitive to the Spirit? ## Bear Testimony Frequently (Page 212) A testimony is a spiritual witness and assur- ance given by the Holy Ghost. To bear testimony is to give a simple, direct declaration of belief—a feeling, an assurance, a conviction of gospel truth. Sharing your testimony often is one of the most powerful ways of inviting the Spirit and helping others feel the Spirit. It adds a current, personal witness to the truths you have taught from the scriptures. An effective missionary teaches, testifies, and invites others to do things that build faith in Jesus Christ. This includes making promises that come from living true principles. For example, a missionary might say, “I know as you keep the Sabbath day holy, you will find more peace in your heart.” For your testimony to have convincing power, you must be sincere. Powerful testimony is not dependent on eloquence or the volume of your voice but on the conviction of your heart. Strive daily to strengthen your understanding and conviction of the doctrines and principles you are to teach. Bear testimony often to seal the truth of the principles or doctrine you are teaching. As often as possible, teach, then testify, and testify as you teach. Your testimony may be as simple as “Jesus Christ is the Son of God” or “I have learned for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.” You may also share a brief experience about how you gained this knowledge. Bear testimony several times in each lesson, not just at the end. Bear testimony that what your companion has taught is from God. Bear testimony that the principle you are going to teach will bless the investigators’ lives if they will follow it. Talk about how living a principle has blessed your life. People may sometimes intellectually question what you teach, but it is difficult to question a sincere, heartfelt testimony. When you testify, pray that those you are teaching will feel the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. When you testify, you help create an environment for investigators to feel the Holy Ghost confirming your witness of the truth. This prepares them to accept the commitments you will extend. Brigham Young was not baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the first year of his learning about the restored gospel. But of his conversion he said: “If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared, in the most exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it by learning and worldly wisdom, they would have been to me like smoke which arises only to vanish away. But when I saw a man without eloquence or talents for public speaking, who could only say, ‘I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord,’ the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my understanding, and a light, glory, and immortality were before me. I was encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself that the testimony of the man was true” (in Journal of Discourses, 1:90). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 213) The passages below are examples of bearing testimony. Read each of the questions and scriptures. Write your answers in your study journal. - In these verses, of what do the apostles and prophets testify? - How strongly do they believe what they are saying? How can you tell that they are convinced of the truth? - When you say, “I know that ________ is true,” what do you mean?

Without the completed action, the commitment is hollow. Change can be hard. Your role is to help strengthen people in their resolve to change. You should do all you can to help people keep their commitments. Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time especially for commandments such as chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and tithing. As you and ward leaders work with people to help them keep their commitments, show understanding. Be patient but persistent. You have not finished your ministry until people are living these commitments, or in other words, until they have repented (see 3 Nephi 18:32). Sometimes several visits may be necessary for you to help people develop strong enough faith in a principle to lead to repentance. Following up begins when you first visit and teach people: - Have them write their commitment on something you leave with them, such as a pamphlet or a card with your names and phone number. - Make sure people know that you will make brief, daily visits between teaching appointments. Explain that your purpose is to support and help them. Give them an idea of what you will do during those visits. - Make specific notes in the Notes/To Do List section of your planner to follow up tomorrow on every commitment invitation you have extended today. Make frequent contact, daily if possible, to find out how people are progressing with their commitments, answer questions, help them overcome challenges, teach additional lessons, read together from the Book of Mormon, share passages of scripture, or use audiovisual materials. As you visit people often, you will strengthen the spiritual feelings they felt as you taught them']","The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints emphasizes prayerfully reading the Book of Mormon to gain the Spirit, strengthen testimony, and respond to objections by helping individuals see that accepting the Book of Mormon's truth is key to believing in Jesus Christ, Joseph Smith as a prophet, and the church itself. For example, reading and praying about the Book of Mormon helps investigators resolve concerns about divine revelation and the prophet Joseph Smith. Additionally, bearing testimony is a vital part of this process because it provides a sincere, heartfelt witness of gospel truths, inviting the Spirit and reinforcing faith. Sharing personal experiences and convictions helps others feel the Spirit's confirming witness, which is essential for overcoming doubts and strengthening their commitment to the gospel.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How Alma 6:6 and Alma 16:16–17 show members help missionary work and trust God?,"['<1-hop>\n\nway. That way is through the members of the Church. Whenever there is a member who introduces an investigator, there is an immediate support system. The member bears testimony of the truth of the work. He is anxious for the happiness of his investigator friend. He becomes excited as that friend makes progress in learning the gospel. “The full-time missionaries may do the actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up that teaching with the offering of his home to carry on this missionary service. He will bear sincere testimony of the divinity of the work. He will be there to answer questions when the missionaries are not around. He will be a friend to the convert who is making a big and often difficult change. . . . The process of bringing new people into the Church is not the responsibility alone of the missionaries. They succeed best when members become the source from which new investigators are found” (Ensign, May 1999, 105–6). The starting point in building strong relationships with members is the bishop. Offer to help and serve in any righteous way that he asks. Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing or a burden to the bishop?” Develop a “How can I help?” attitude. If you will look for opportunities to love, serve, and teach, the bishop and ward members will be more likely to trust you with their family members and friends. “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.” – THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH TEACHINGS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH, 113. Consider the following excerpt from a letter written by a missionary to his mission president: *Dear President, The assistants called today telling me I’m being transferred. I felt that I should write and thank you for sending me to this area. It seems like it was just yesterday that you were telling me about the challenges that lay ahead. Our first Sunday confirmed what you told me. We received a lukewarm welcome to the ward. The only ray of light that first Sunday was Scott, the new ward mission leader. He had been transferred to the Air Force base a month earlier and had been serving as ward mission leader for two weeks. Scott invited us to his home for dinner our first Sunday to discuss what could be done to get the work moving. After dinner, we knelt in prayer and asked Heavenly Father for His direction. As we prayed, we felt a sense of peace and determination. We determined that the best way to move the work forward was to gain the trust of the members. We decided to follow Ammon’s example and serve them. We started with the bishop. Because of the lack of baptisms in the area and the lack of effort from the previous missionaries, he was understandably less than excited at our request to meet with him. He eventually invited us over to his home for dinner. We learned that the bishop was preparing to remove the carpet from his living room and restore the hardwood floor found underneath. We volunteered our help and he accepted. At the conclusion of the project, the bishop asked us to speak in a sacrament meeting. We took this as evidence that he was beginning to trust us. We followed this same pattern of service as we met with other members. We found opportunities to help them in a variety of simple ways. When we were not with the members, we were knocking on doors and talking to as many people as we could about the restored gospel. We were blessed with people to teach, and the members saw us bringing people to church whom we were finding on our own. The attitude of the whole ward began to change. There was an increasing excitement about missionary work. Once the members trusted us, the work hastened. Many baptisms followed.* Many members of the Church have fears about doing missionary work. Many are unsure where to begin or what to say. Many fear that they will lose close friends if they try to share the gospel with them. There are many ways to help the members. For example, help build their faith by teaching them the message of the Restoration and other doctrines of the lessons. Help them feel the Spirit and power of our message. Strengthening their understanding of the doctrine of Christ will do more to increase their trust in you and to build their excitement to do missionary work than anything else you can do. Help them understand that offering the restored gospel will flow more naturally out of relationships where they are seeking to love and serve their family members and friends. Teach them the principles from the “Go About Doing Good” section of this chapter. Encourage members to “join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who [know] not God” (Alma 6:6). In all you do with members, seek to lift and build their faith to help them do missionary work. In addition to working with active members, seek to find people to teach through prospective elders, less-active members, and new members. These members are likely to have many friends of other faiths and be blessed as they share the restored gospel with their family members and friends. In every visit with members, do all you can to encourage them to: - Pray and follow the Spirit. - Give service. - Develop friendships. - Open their mouths to share the restored gospel. - Invite others to do things to increase their faith in Christ. Every referral you receive from a member should be treated as something precious. When a member gives you the name of a friend to call or visit, respond quickly and report the results back to the member. #### Ideas for Helping Members (Page 176) There are many ways to encourage members to become more', '<2-hop>\n\n## How to Begin Teaching (Page 190) The first few moments with investigators are very important. Investigators must learn to trust you. Begin your first visit in a warm, respectful, genuine manner. Ask a few simple questions to help you understand their religious background and their expectations regarding your visits. For example, ask, “What role has religion played in your life?” Do not, however, ask personal questions that would make them uncomfortable. Before you begin, ask all who are present to join with you in the lesson. Encourage them to turn off the television and remove other distractions so that the Spirit of the Lord will not be hindered. Explain that you would like to begin and end each lesson in prayer. Suggest that you will offer the opening prayer. Pray simply but fervently that the Lord will bless the people you are teaching in every aspect of their lives, and especially that they can feel the truth of what you will teach. Demonstrate sincere interest and love for the investigators and faith in the converting power of the gospel (see Moroni 7:43–48). As guided by the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following to your investigators: - Because God is our Heavenly Father, we are all brothers and sisters. We would like to refer to you as brothers and sisters. - Each person we teach has personal challenges and concerns. No matter what your needs or concerns might be, the Savior and His teachings—the gospel—will help you. - Our message will enable you to improve the quality of your lives. It will help you deal with the problems and challenges that we all face in life. - Our message, which is centered in Jesus Christ, is of great value and importance. - We all make mistakes in life, and these mistakes create feelings of guilt and shame. These feelings cannot be relieved without repentance and forgiveness. They can be fully healed through the Atonement of Christ. - Our message cannot be learned all at once. Understanding will come over time through prayer, study, experience, and keeping God’s commandments. - We have weaknesses, as everyone does. We may not speak the language very well or be able to answer every question you have. But we have been called by a prophet of God to share what we know. We know that our message is true. - We will be guides so that you can learn the truth of our message for yourselves. It is your choice to accept and act on the message. Therefore, you should feel free to ask questions. - As you sincerely seek to understand our message, you may face challenges, but God will help you. - As you accept our message, you will learn how to make covenants, or promises, with God. You will learn how to make changes to bring your lives in closer harmony with His teachings. You will want to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be baptized by proper authority (see John 3:5). Before teaching the doctrines in a lesson, consider giving a simple overview of what you are going to teach. Help people see that it will have personal relevance for them. Many of the investigators you teach have been prepared by the Lord (see Alma 16:16–17). As you share spiritual experiences together in the first meeting, they will recognize you as servants of the Lord.']","Alma 6:6 talks about members praying and fasting for those who don't know God, which helps build faith and trust. Alma 16:16–17 shows that investigators can recognize the Spirit and the truth through shared spiritual experiences, which helps members and investigators trust each other and the gospel. Together, these verses show that praying, fasting, and sharing spiritual experiences help members support missionary work and trust in God's power.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
May 1999 how help new members stay active and how members support them in May 1999?,"['<1-hop>\n\nhelp teach these principles. President Gordon B. Hinckley related the following concerning the challenges many new converts face: *I received the other day a very interesting letter. It was written by a woman who joined the Church a year ago. She writes: “My journey into the Church was unique and quite challenging. This past year has been the hardest year that I have ever lived in my life. It has also been the most rewarding. As a new member, I continue to be challenged every day.” She goes on to say that when she joined the Church she did not feel support from the leadership in her ward. Her bishop seemed indifferent to her as a new member. Rebuffed, as she felt, she turned back to her mission president, who opened opportunities for her. She states that “Church members don’t know what it is like to be a new member. . . . Therefore, it’s almost impossible for them to know how to support us.” I challenge you, my brothers and sisters, that if you do not know what it is like, you try to imagine what it is like. It can be terribly lonely. It can be disappointing. It can be frightening. We of this Church are far more different from the world than we are prone to think we are. This woman goes on: “When we as investigators become members of the Church, we are surprised to discover that we have entered into a completely foreign world, a world that has its own traditions, culture, and language. We discover that there is no one person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration and anger that we leave. We go back to the world from which we came, where we knew who we were, where we contributed, and where we could speak the language” [Ensign, May 1999, 108].* #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 229) Read the previous account. Write answers to the following questions in your study journal, or discuss them with your companion. Make appropriate goals and plans. - According to this account, what are some of the factors that make it difficult for new members to remain active? - How can having members involved from the beginning of the teaching process help with these challenges? - Think of those you are teaching. How can you better involve members to help investigators begin to make the social transition into the Church? ## Home and Visiting Teaching (Page 229) Stake presidents and bishops, coordinating with the mission president, may use missionaries to visit less-active and part-member families. In appropriate situations, they may request that full-time missionaries participate in home teaching and in visiting teaching. These teaching opportunities should strengthen members, increase the ability of the missionaries to teach, and help missionaries obtain referrals (see “Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). ## Work with the Ward Council to Strengthen New and Less-Active Members (Page 229) Teaching and baptizing investigators is under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity together. You may often be invited to attend ward council and priesthood executive committee meetings. Your first priority is to make sure that your investigators are at Church. Frequently this will mean that you will accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council or priesthood executive committee. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: *“Every new convert needs three things: “1. A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems. “2. An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. . . . “3. Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (Moro. 6:4). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism” (Ensign, May 1999, 106).* The ward council will take the lead in providing a friend, responsibility, and spiritual nourishment for new converts. You will help them as requested. Priesthood leaders and members will do the fellowshipping, with your assistance. ### Friendship (Page 230) - Before baptism and confirmation, ensure that members are present at every lesson, if possible. These members should be with the investigators often to answer their questions, understand their challenges, and encourage them. - Invite members to attend the baptismal service and to welcome new converts into the ward. Members help new converts feel comfortable in various Church meetings. They should also introduce them to other members. - Introduce the investigators to the bishop, his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and other ward leaders as soon as possible. Explain the roles of the bishop and other ward leaders. ### Opportunities to Serve (Page 230) • Help male converts understand and prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. Explain that priesthood quorums provide opportunities to learn, worship, and serve together. • Involve new converts and less-active', '<2-hop>\n\nway. That way is through the members of the Church.

We were coming back from district meeting, and it was the only empty seat so I sat down and started to look at my mail. Of course, the first one to be read was yours, with the baby pictures of Evan. I noticed that the eyes next to me were also looking at the pictures, and I looked over to meet eyes with an older woman. She gave me a half smile and looked out the window. She then closed her eyes like she was going to sleep. I prayed, ‘Heavenly Father, I want to talk to her. Please help me.’ A minute later she opened her eyes and sat up straight, and I quickly said, ‘Don’t you think he is cute?’ I showed her the pictures of baby Evan and started talking about families with her. I asked her about her kids, and she got teary-eyed and told me a story about how her daughter hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She cried and I cried with her. I told her about the plan of salvation and how Heavenly Father knows her and knows what she is going through. I cried and told her that I know that her daughter loves her because I am a daughter of a mother that loves me, and I love her. I explained that sometimes people make bad decisions and that her daughter has agency. She told me, smiling, ‘I bet your mother really misses you, and she will not let you go when she sees you again.’ She thanked me for talking with her and gave me her address so that we can share the gospel with her. As she was getting off the bus, she said, ‘I got on the wrong bus, but I didn’t get off. No one sat by me until you came . . . and look what happened.’ God’s plan is perfect!”* What principles from this chapter do you see in this account? Review the chapter and make a list in your study journal. Which of these principles can you try to apply today? - Read John 15:12–13; 21:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2; and Mosiah 18:8–10. How well are you fulfilling your responsibility to love and serve others? How can you improve? Write your response in your study journal. - How will people know that you are a servant of the Lord? As you ponder this question, study Moroni 7:3–5; Matthew 7:20; John 13:34–35. Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Read 3 Nephi 18:31–32; Alma 8:16; Alma 24:7–8; and Alma 32:41. Consider what these verses teach about working with former investigators. Record what you learn in your study journal and teach it to your companion. ### Companion Study (Page 185) - Using your daily planner, make plans to meet with recent converts. Ask them to share how they were prepared for the gospel. Ask questions like: When did you first come in contact with the Church? What finally convinced you to meet with missionaries? Write what you learn in your study journal. - Review each of the following topics. Using the lessons, prepare a simple finding approach. Practice teaching in a finding setting and quickly relating each topic to the Restoration. - Feeling a need for more direction and purpose in life. - Wanting to draw nearer to God. - Needing help with important decisions. - Read pages 66–68 of Our Search for Happiness and pages 59–64 of True to the Faith to better understand the doctrinal foundation of family history work. Prepare a talk on family history work, and share it with your companion. - Imagine that you and your companion are transferred into a new area. You find the area book in good condition, but you have no investigators. What would you do to add people to your teaching pool as rapidly as possible? Make plans to implement some of these ideas today. - The following idea has been successful for many missionaries and members. Read and study this idea with your companion. - Help members make a list of friends, relatives, and acquaintances with whom they could share the gospel. Review this list with the members, and help them prayerfully select someone they would like to prepare to hear the gospel. - Help them set a day by which they will (a) work to have the person or family prepared to be taught in their home or (b) do some other fellowshipping activity to prepare them. Setting a date gives members a goal and helps them exercise faith. - Help them plan what they will do between now and the date they have set. - Follow up with them regularly to support and encourage them. Invite them to share their successes and concerns. Discuss how you can apply this idea in the area in which you are serving. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 186) - Read and discuss the “Finding through Your Own Efforts” section. - Discuss how']","The principles from John 13:34–35 emphasize that loving one another as Christ has loved us is the defining mark of His disciples, which helps missionaries establish trust and genuine relationships during their first visits. By demonstrating sincere interest, love, and respect, missionaries can create a trusting environment where investigators feel valued and cared for. Additionally, John 3:5 highlights the importance of being born of water and the Spirit to enter the kingdom of God, underscoring the need for teaching the gospel's essential ordinances, such as baptism, as part of spiritual progression. Combining these themes, missionaries can foster trust through love and then clearly teach the necessity of baptism and spiritual rebirth, helping investigators understand their role in entering the kingdom of God and encouraging them to make covenants with God, as taught in John 3:5.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

If you and your companion become separated, contact your mission president immediately. > 2.2.3 ### Working in Your Area “Go and labor with [your] mights” (Jacob 5:72), and concentrate your efforts in your assigned teaching area. Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88). You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2).

If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able. > 2.2.4 ### Working with People outside Your Area During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may: Share a message with them. Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6). Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4). With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5). When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission: Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time. Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible. > 2.3 ## Missionary Work Activities Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities. > 2.3.1 ### Companion Exchanges In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7). - Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders. - In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer. - District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district. - Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone. - Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones. - Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president. - A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should: - Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate. - Plan the companion exchange in advance. - Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping. - Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel. - Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching. - Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve. - Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement. - Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange. - Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president. > 2.3.2 ### Transfers The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit. When you are transferred: - Go directly to your new area to join your new companion. - Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling. - When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office. - If your companion is transferred and you are', '<2-hop>\n\n# Message from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Dear Fellow Missionary: After His Resurrection, Jesus Christ appeared to His disciples and commanded them to “make disciples of” (see Matthew 28:19, footnote a) “all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19–20). You have been called by revelation through God’s chosen servants to assist the Apostles in this great work of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world in order to make disciples of all nations. When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6). To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you. Heavenly Father loves you, and He will help you to love and bless His children wherever you serve. He will empower you and the people you serve, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to be truly “converted unto the Lord” (Alma 23:6). These missionary standards are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They will help protect you physically, spiritually, and emotionally and help you be the disciple Jesus Christ needs you to become. If you have questions about a standard, prayerfully ask the Lord to help you understand its importance, and then if needed, ask your companion, your young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders for help. Regularly study these standards with your companion and strive to obey them. We congratulate you for accepting a call to serve a full-time mission, and we pray you will find true peace and joy in serving the Lord Jesus Christ. First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints # should serve with a sincere desire to help others without any expected outcomes. Follow all service project rules (see 7.2), especially any about not teaching while serving and not serving where you would be alone with children. If someone expresses interest in your message, reply very briefly and arrange to meet with them at a different time and location to share a message. For more information see section 7.2, “Guidelines for Service.” #']","The guidance in the Doctrine and Covenants emphasizes the importance of obedience, safety, and spiritual focus in missionary work. The mission guidelines specify that missionaries should follow standards such as staying in companionships, avoiding being alone with children, and seeking permission before leaving their areas or working outside their assigned zones. These instructions align with the principles in the Doctrine and Covenants, which encourage missionaries to act with faith, prudence, and obedience to protect themselves physically and spiritually while fulfilling their responsibilities to teach and serve others.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How Gordon B Hinckley talk about the challenges new members face and how can we help them stay in the church?,"['<1-hop>\n\nhelp teach these principles. President Gordon B. Hinckley related the following concerning the challenges many new converts face: *I received the other day a very interesting letter. It was written by a woman who joined the Church a year ago. She writes: “My journey into the Church was unique and quite challenging. This past year has been the hardest year that I have ever lived in my life. It has also been the most rewarding. As a new member, I continue to be challenged every day.” She goes on to say that when she joined the Church she did not feel support from the leadership in her ward. Her bishop seemed indifferent to her as a new member. Rebuffed, as she felt, she turned back to her mission president, who opened opportunities for her. She states that “Church members don’t know what it is like to be a new member. . . . Therefore, it’s almost impossible for them to know how to support us.” I challenge you, my brothers and sisters, that if you do not know what it is like, you try to imagine what it is like. It can be terribly lonely. It can be disappointing. It can be frightening. We of this Church are far more different from the world than we are prone to think we are. This woman goes on: “When we as investigators become members of the Church, we are surprised to discover that we have entered into a completely foreign world, a world that has its own traditions, culture, and language. We discover that there is no one person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration and anger that we leave. We go back to the world from which we came, where we knew who we were, where we contributed, and where we could speak the language” [Ensign, May 1999, 108].* #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 229) Read the previous account. Write answers to the following questions in your study journal, or discuss them with your companion. Make appropriate goals and plans. - According to this account, what are some of the factors that make it difficult for new members to remain active? - How can having members involved from the beginning of the teaching process help with these challenges? - Think of those you are teaching. How can you better involve members to help investigators begin to make the social transition into the Church? ## Home and Visiting Teaching (Page 229) Stake presidents and bishops, coordinating with the mission president, may use missionaries to visit less-active and part-member families. In appropriate situations, they may request that full-time missionaries participate in home teaching and in visiting teaching. These teaching opportunities should strengthen members, increase the ability of the missionaries to teach, and help missionaries obtain referrals (see “Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). ## Work with the Ward Council to Strengthen New and Less-Active Members (Page 229) Teaching and baptizing investigators is under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity together. You may often be invited to attend ward council and priesthood executive committee meetings. Your first priority is to make sure that your investigators are at Church. Frequently this will mean that you will accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council or priesthood executive committee. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: *“Every new convert needs three things: “1. A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems. “2. An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. . . . “3. Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (Moro. 6:4). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism” (Ensign, May 1999, 106).* The ward council will take the lead in providing a friend, responsibility, and spiritual nourishment for new converts. You will help them as requested. Priesthood leaders and members will do the fellowshipping, with your assistance. ### Friendship (Page 230) - Before baptism and confirmation, ensure that members are present at every lesson, if possible. These members should be with the investigators often to answer their questions, understand their challenges, and encourage them. - Invite members to attend the baptismal service and to welcome new converts into the ward. Members help new converts feel comfortable in various Church meetings. They should also introduce them to other members. - Introduce the investigators to the bishop, his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and other ward leaders as soon as possible. Explain the roles of the bishop and other ward leaders. ### Opportunities to Serve (Page 230) • Help male converts understand and prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. Explain that priesthood quorums provide opportunities to learn, worship, and serve together. • Involve new converts and less-active', '<2-hop>\n\nFrom the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ## Addressing the Importance of the Family (Page 173) The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity. Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following: *There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity. Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.* You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration: *The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrines and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about . . .* The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world. ## The Importance of Members (Page 174) Work with members of the Church to find people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to investigate the restored gospel. This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and less-active members, recent converts, and part-member families. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting. Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better']","Gordon B Hinckley said that new members face challenges like feeling unsupported and lonely because they enter a new world with its own culture and language, and they often feel frustrated and angry, which can lead them to leave. To help them stay, he emphasized the importance of having a friend in the church, giving them responsibilities, and nourishing them spiritually. Members should be involved from the beginning, welcoming new members, introducing them to leaders, and helping them feel part of the church community, which can make their journey easier and help them remain active.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints explain the Great Apostasy and the need for restoration according to the context?,"['<1-hop>\n\n## The Great Apostasy (Page 49) After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept the doctrines of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the doctrines were corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost. Without revelation and priesthood authority, people relied on human wisdom to interpret the scriptures and the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. False ideas were taught as truth. Much of the knowledge of the true character and nature of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was lost. The doctrines of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or forgotten. The priesthood authority given to Christ’s Apostles was no longer present on the earth. This apostasy eventually led to the emergence of many churches. After centuries of spiritual darkness, truth-seeking men and women protested against current religious practices. They recognized that many of the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel had been changed or lost. They sought for greater spiritual light, and many spoke of the need for a restoration of truth. They did not claim, however, that God had called them to be a prophet. Instead, they tried to reform teachings and practices that they believed had been changed or corrupted. Their efforts led to the organization of many Protestant churches. This Reformation resulted in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the final Restoration. The Savior’s Apostles foretold this universal apostasy. They also foretold that the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church would be restored once more upon the earth. #### Scripture Study (Page 49) Study these scriptures to learn more anout the great apostacy: - 1 Nephi 13, 2 Nephi 26:20–21, 2 Nephi 28, 4 Nephi 1:27, D&C 86:1–3, Matthew 24:9–11, Mark 12:1–9, Acts 3:19–21 - Acts 20:28–30, Galatians 1:6–9, 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 (JST verses 2, 3, 7–9), 1 Timothy 4:1–3, 2 Timothy 4:3–4, 2 Peter 2:1–2, Amos 8:11–12 - Topical Guide: “Apostasy of the Early Christian Church”, True to the Faith, “Apostasy,” pages 13–14 Our Search for Happiness, pages 23–32 Jesus the Christ, chapter 40, “The Long Night of Apostasy” #### The Great Apostasy (Page 50) Investigators must understand that a universal apostasy occurred following the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. If there had been no apostasy, there would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As guided by the Spirit, teach investigators about the Great Apostasy at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. **Key Points** - The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see Ephesians 2:19–20; 4:11–14). These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer upon others the priesthood authority. - People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see Matthew 24:9; 1 Nephi 11:32–34; 2 Nephi 27:5). With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation ceased, and doctrine became corrupted. - Even before the death of the Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. The simple doctrines and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see Isaiah 24:5). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrines from them (1 Nephi 13:26–40). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see 3 John 1:9–10). People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see 2 Timothy 4:3–4). - Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshiped according to the light they possessed and have received answers to their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). - Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy. > Lesson One: Sixth Principle ## The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith (Page 50) When the circumstances were right, Heavenly Father once again reached out to His children in love. He called a young man named Joseph Smith as a prophet. Through him the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth. Joseph Smith lived in the United States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at the time. It was at a time of great religious excitement in the eastern United States. His family members were deeply religious and constantly sought for truth. But many ministers claimed to have the true gospel. Joseph desired “to know which of all the sects was right,” (Joseph Smith—History 1:18). The Bible taught there was “one Lord, one faith, one baptism”', '<2-hop>\n\nprayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts . . . the Spirit of the Lord. There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“The Power of the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, June 1988, 6). ## Use the Book of Mormon to Respond to Objections (Page 122) Many people will not believe everything you teach. President Ezra Taft Benson taught how the Book of Mormon can be the central resource in responding to such situations: “We are to use the Book of Mormon in handling objections to the Church. . . . “. . . All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. . . . The only problem the objector has to resolve forhimself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation. “Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively. We are not obligated to answer every objection. Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand” (A Witness and a Warning, 4–5). For example, sincere investigators might object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom. Help them see that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation. You might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.” Investigators must resolve for themselves their concerns and objections. You can help as you focus them on what will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. When they strengthen their testimony of the Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections and concerns. As you answer concerns, remember that our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his successors—who receive direct revelation from God. There- fore, the first question for an investigator to answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. #### Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon (Page 123) One way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 123) In your study journal, write down how you would refer to Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon to respond to the following objections or concerns: - “I don’t believe that God speaks to people anymore.” - “I believe that I can worship God in my own way rather than through some organized religion.” - “Why must I give up drinking wine with my meals if I join your church?” - “Why do I need religion?”']","The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that after the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles, a Great Apostasy occurred, leading to the loss of priesthood authority, doctrinal corruption, and the emergence of many false churches. This apostasy was characterized by the rejection and killing of Christ's followers, the removal of divine authority, and changes to scriptures and ordinances. Because of this, a restoration of the gospel was necessary, which was brought about through divine revelation to Joseph Smith, who was called as a prophet. The restoration reestablished the original doctrines, priesthood authority, and ordinances of Jesus Christ's church, standing in contrast to the spiritual darkness of the apostasy and fulfilling the prophecy that the gospel would be restored in the last days.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does the ENSIGN relate to the Ensign in the context of missionary work and spiritual gifts?,"['<1-hop>\n\nlet me teach—even when I didn’t think I could do it, even when he probably wondered if I could do it. And because he encouraged me to speak, listen, and teach, my language skills began to progress more quickly, and I felt that I had become a tool of our Father in Heaven instead of being simply another elder’s quiet companion. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 146) - If you are working with a new missionary, how can you better help your companion learn the language? - If you are a new missionary, what kind of help might you ask from your senior companion? ## Culture and Language Learning (Page 146) Culture and language are closely related. Understanding the culture will help explain why language is used the way it is. Strive to understand the culture of the people so that you can communicate the unique aspects of the message of the Restoration in a way that will be clear to them. One of the greatest things you can do to gain people’s trust and love is to embrace their culture in appropriate ways. Many great missionaries have done so (see 1 Corinthians 9:20–23). Seek to have the people feel comfortable with you and your language. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 147) - Imagine that you are serving a mission in Asia. You are preparing to teach someone about resurrection, and you know that Buddhists believe in reincarnation. How will you teach about resurrection in such a way that the investigator will understand that this doctrine is distinctly different from reincarnation? What words and phrases might you need to learn to accomplish this task? - Think about the cultural and religious background of the people you teach. Identify an aspect of their background that might lead them to misunderstand the doctrines of the gospel. Plan ways to teach these doctrines clearly. ## The Gift of Tongue (Page 147) Seek the gifts of the Spirit, including the gift of tongues and the interpretation of tongues. More than anything else, this will help you speak and understand the language of the people in your mission. You will not obtain this gift without effort on your part; you need to actively seek it. Part of seeking the gift of tongues is to labor and struggle and to do all you can to learn the language. Trust that the Spirit will help you as you live the way you should and do your very best. Have faith that you can have the gift of tongues in its true and most comprehensive sense. When you feel you are struggling to express yourself as clearly as you would like, remember that the Spirit is able to speak to the hearts of all of God’s children. President Thomas S. Monson taught: “There is one language . . . that is common to each missionary—the language of the Spirit. It is not learned from textbooks written by men of letters, nor is it acquired through reading and memorization. The language of the Spirit comes to him who seeks with all his heart to know God and keep His divine commandments. Proficiency in this language permits one to breach barriers, overcome obstacles, and touch the human heart” (“The Spirit Giveth Life,” Ensign, June 1997, 2). #### Remember This (Page 147) - Study the doctrines and lessons you teach in your native language first. - Learn to express these doctrines and your feelings about them in your mission language. - Create a language study plan and regularly try new ideas as you seek to improve in your mission language. - Seek the guidance of the Spirit to help you understand and communicate with the people of your mission. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 148) ### Personal Study (Page 148) - Review the suggestions in this chapter. Identify a suggestion you have not yet tried, and set a goal to try it for the next few days. - At your next district meeting, ask an experienced missionary with good language ability what he or she has done to learn the language. - Read and discuss the following statement by Elder Richard G. Scott: “Where . . . national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God, set them aside. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished” (“Removing Barriers to Happiness,” Ensign, May 1998, 87). Think about the ways that the culture in the area where you serve is different from your own. Make a list of the differences. Then cross out any that conflict with the teachings of the gospel. Consider each of those that remain, and think about how you can make these customs your own. - Build a study plan to prepare you to do one of the following things in your mission language: - Tell the Joseph Smith story. - Summarize 3 Nephi 11. - Summarize Alma 32. - Tell the story of Nephi and the brass plates (see 1 Nephi 3–5). - Explain dispensations. - Share a personal experience. - Make note cards for words you don’t know in one of the lessons. Carry them with you until you have learned them all. ### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching. Practice summarizing them in your own words. - Review the ideas in this chapter. Discuss which suggestions you could use in companion study during the next week. - If you are training a new missionary, take note of situations when your companion is not understood. Make a list of relevant words, phrases, or grammar that would help your companion. Explain and practice how to use what is on the list in upcoming, planned activities. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 148) - Invite native speakers to', '<2-hop>\n\nGhost,” 704). As a member of the Church, you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost by priesthood authority. This gift entitles you to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as you remain worthy of it. Pray for the Spirit’s guidance, and valiantly follow the promptings you receive. “The gift of the Holy Ghost comes after one repents and becomes worthy. . . . The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ so deeply that no earthly power or authority can separate him from that knowledge."" – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST—A SURE COMPASS,” ENSIGN, APR. 1996, 4 - **The Holy Spirit of Promise.** The Holy Ghost is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise (see D&C 88:3). To be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable to God. The Holy Spirit of Promise testifies to the Father that the saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants associated with them have been kept. Those who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has (see D&C 76:51–60; Ephesians 1:13–14). All covenants and performances must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise if they are to be valid after this life (see D&C 132:7, 18–19, 26). Breaking covenants may remove the sealing. - **Gifts of the Spirit.** The gifts of the Spirit are special spiritual blessings that the Lord gives to worthy individuals for their own benefit and for their use in blessing others. For example, missionaries who must learn a new language may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help in learning a language. Several gifts of the Spirit are described in Moroni 10:8–18; Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33; and 1 Corinthians 12:1–12. These are only some examples of the many gifts of the Spirit. The Lord may bless you in other ways depending on your faithfulness, your needs, and the needs of those you serve. You should desire spiritual gifts and earnestly seek for them (see D&C 46:8; 1 Corinthians 12:31; 14:1, 12). These gifts come by prayer, faith, and works, according to God’s will (see D&C 63:9–12; 84:64–73). #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 106) Read the references below: - Bible Dictionary, “Holy Ghost,” “Light of Christ,” and “Spirit.” - Our Search for Happiness, 84–86, 91–92. - True to the Faith, “Holy Ghost,” 81–84, and “Spiritual Gifts,” 165–67. Write a description of the nature and role of the Holy Ghost. - Read Acts 4:23–33. - How did Peter and John seek spiritual gifts? - How did the Lord answer their prayers? - What can you learn from this experience about your own work? ## The Power of the Spirit in Conversion (Page 106) The power of the Holy Ghost is central to conversion. Strive to understand the doctrine of conversion and also the experience of conversion. President Boyd K. Packer explained the central role of the Spirit in conversion: “When conversion takes place, it is through the power of the Spirit. In order to succeed in missionary work, these three things must occur: “We must understand what an investigator must feel in order to receive conversion. “We must understand how a missionary must feel in order to teach with the converting power of the Spirit. “And then we must understand how a member must feel to succeed in participating in the conversion experience” (mission presidents’ conference, 3 Apr. 1985). The better you understand how investigators, missionaries, and members feel when they receive the witness of the Spirit, the better you will understand your own role, which is to: - Be edified and have your mind enlightened as you search the scriptures and teach the doctrine. - Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear witness. You do this by teaching and testifying of the message of the Restoration. Teach as directed by the Spirit, and testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true. - Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting the message to each person’s needs. - Invite people to act. Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and make and keep covenants. Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke of the power of the Spirit: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed. When individuals . . . feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word. This is how we come to feel the gospel is true” (“Now Is the Time,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 75). The Holy Ghost works in the hearts of people to bring about these changes. As people choose to keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly and will develop the faith to obey Christ. Thus, you should help the people you work with grow in faith by inviting them to repent and to make and keep commitments. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 107) - Read one or two of the following passages, and ponder what an investigator must feel to be converted. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and members: 2 Nephi 4:16–35; Enos 1; Mosiah 4–5; 18:7–14; 27–28; Alma 5; 17–22; 32; 36; 38 - Read one or two of the following passages and ponder what you as a missionary and as a member must feel to teach with converting power.

"How does 1 Nephi 4:6 exemplify the importance of relying on the Spirit, as discussed in the context of developing Christlike attributes and applying the teachings from the Book of Mormon to missionary work, particularly in the process of gaining spiritual confidence and confirming the truthfulness of the message of the Restoration?","['<1-hop>\n\nto apply one of these characteristics. Repeat this activity regularly using Book of Mormon missionaries. - Invite missionaries to share experiences in which the Book of Mormon has helped their investigators in the conversion process. - Have missionaries share their best Book of Mormon answer to a question of the soul. ### Mission President (Page 128) - Teach the missionaries how to use the Book of Mormon to confirm the truthfulness of the message of the Restoration. - Read 1 Nephi 1 with the missionaries and compare it with Joseph Smith’s experience. - Provide missionaries with a clean paperback copy of the Book of Mormon. Have them highlight in different colors: - Each reference to Jesus Christ (any of His names or pronouns referring to Him). - His words (spoken by Him or by prophets when they say, “Thus saith the Lord”). - His attributes. - The doctrines and principles contained in the Book of Mormon. At the bottom of each page ask the missionaries to count the total number of items referenced. In interviews and during district meetings during the two- or three-month period for this activity, have missionaries share with each other what they’ve learned. You might consider doing a similar activity with the entire mission highlighting references to faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, or any of the fundamental principles of the gospel. - During interviews, invite missionaries to share with you Book of Mormon scriptures that have changed their lives. - Help missionaries see how the Book of Mormon teaches the doctrines from the missionary lessons. For example, if the topic were the Atonement, have missionaries write in one column each major element of the Atonement taught in the Book of Mormon, including its references. Then, in a second column, have them list side-by-side those same elements as taught in the Bible. Have your missionaries leave blank those elements that are missing or not taught in the Bible. It will become very evident to the missionary how the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our doctrine. This same activity can be done with the other doctrines that missionaries teach. - Identify pertinent questions of the soul for people in your mission. Invite missionaries to find answers in the Book of Mormon. > Beginning of Chapter 6 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes? (Page 129) #### Consider This - How can I develop attributes that will make me a more powerful and effective minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How will developing Christlike attributes help me fulfill my purpose as a missionary? - Which attribute do I most need to develop? ## Overview (Page 129) At the beginning of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ walked along the shore of the sea of Galilee and called out to two fishermen, Peter and Andrew. “Follow me,” He said, “and I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew 4:19; see also Mark 1:17). The Lord has also called you to His work, and He invites you to follow Him. The invitation to follow Christ is an invitation to follow His example and to become like Him. Some chapters in Preach My Gospel focus on what you need to do as a missionary—how to study, how to teach, how to manage time wisely. Just as vital as what you do, however, is who you are. The restored gospel enables you to become like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The Savior has shown the way. He has set the perfect example, and He commands us to become as He is (see 3 Nephi 27:27). Learn of Him and seek to incorporate His attributes into your life. Through the power of His Atonement, you can achieve this goal and lead others to achieve it also. The scriptures describe Christlike attributes that are essential for you to eventually develop as a missionary and throughout your life. Study the scripture passages in this chapter and look for other examples of Christlike attributes as you study other passages. Christlike attributes are gifts from God. They come as you use your agency righteously. Ask your Heavenly Father to bless you with these attributes; you cannot develop them without His help. With a desire to please God, recognize your weaknesses and be willing and anxious to improve. #### Scripture Study (Page 130) - What do these scriptures say about following Jesus Christ’s example? - 3 Nephi 12:48, John 13:1–16, 1 Peter 2:21, 3 Nephi 27:21, 27 - What is the relationship between the first principles of the gospel and Christlike attributes? - Moroni 8:25–26 ## Ideas for Studying This Chapter (Page 130) There are many approaches for studying this chapter. Try one of the following ideas: - As you complete the “Attribute Activity” at the end of this chapter, identify the attribute you most need or want to develop. Study the section about that attribute, and set goals for developing it. - Read through the chapter without studying the scriptures, and determine which attribute you want to study more fully. Then study the key scriptures associated with the attribute. Search for additional scriptures not listed in the chapter that teach about the attribute. Record in your study journal ideas for developing the attribute. - Identify an attribute you wish to study. Follow the pattern under the heading “Developing Christlike Attributes” found at the end of the chapter. ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 130) When you have faith in Christ, you believe in Him as the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the Flesh. You accept Him as your Savior and Redeemer and follow His teachings. You believe that your sins can be forgiven through His Atonement. Faith in Him means that you trust Him and are confident that He loves you. Faith leads to action, including repentance, obedience and dedicated service. When you have faith in Jesus Christ, you trust the Lord enough to', '<2-hop>\n\nConstrains (impels forward) or restrains (holds back). | | D&C 50:13-22 | Edifies both teacher and students. | | D&C 88:3; John 14:26 | Gives comfort. | ## Relying on the Spirit (Page 111) As the Lord’s servant, you are to do His work in His way and by His power. Some missionaries feel confident that they know how to be successful. Others lack such confidence. Remember, however, that your confidence and faith should be in Christ, not in yourself. Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and abilities. Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Spirit is basic to teaching and preaching: “No man can preach the Gospel without the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 2:477). “Some few were called and ordained by the Spirit of revelation and prophecy, and began to preach as the Spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened by the power of God” (History of the Church, 4:538). “[Joseph Smith] proceeded to give instruction to the Elders respecting preaching the Gospel, and pressed upon them the necessity of getting the Spirit, so that they might preach with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven” (History of the Church, 4:13). During your weekly and daily planning sessions, you will need to ask some basic questions every day—even many times each day (see the Scripture Study box that follows for examples of questions). Seek inspiration to answer these questions in a way that meets each situation. The answers should then take shape in your plans. But you should also be willing to follow the Spirit and change your plans when unforeseen opportunities arise. Study the following scriptures and consider how they answer these important questions that you should ask each day. Consider what these passages mean for your finding efforts, planning sessions, and personal and companion study. Also consider their meaning as you teach the lessons, invite people to make commitments, follow up on commitments, strengthen new members and less-active members, and work with members. #### Scripture Study (page 112) - Where should I go? - Helaman 10:17, D&C 31:11 - D&C 75:26–27, D&C 79:1–2 - What should I do? - 1 Nephi 4:6, 2 Nephi 32:2–5 - D&C 28:15, D&C 52:3–4 - What should I say? - 2 Nephi 33:1, Alma 5:43–46, Alma 11:22, Helaman 5:18, Helaman 13:3–5 - D&C 33:8–10, D&C 50:13–22, D&C 68:1–4, D&C 75:3–11, D&C 100:5–8 - Matthew 10:19–20, Mark 13:11, 1 Corinthians 2:4–5...12–13, Exodus 4:10–12 - How do I adapt my teaching to the needs of my investigators? - Alma 12:7, Alma 41:1 - 3 Nephi 17:2–3, D&C 71:1, D&C 84:85 - Which scriptures should I use and how should I use them? - Mosiah 18:19-20, D&C 32:4, D&C 71:1 - Mosiah 27:35, D&C 42:11-17, D&C 80:4 = D&C 18:32-36, D&C 68:1-4, Luke 24:13-32 ## A Word of Caution (Page 112) As you pray for inspiration, you should also confirm your feelings. For example, compare your decisions with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets. Be certain that the feelings are consistent with the assignment you have; for example, you will not receive revelation to tell a local bishop how he should perform in his calling. Discuss your decisions and conclusions with your companion, your district leader, or your mission president when appropriate. President Howard W. Hunter offered this counsel: “Let me offer a word of caution. . . . I think if we are not careful . . . , we may begin to try to counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means. I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit. Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” (The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter, 184). The Spirit of the Lord always edifies. Revelation and spiritual experiences are sacred. They should be kept private and discussed only in appropriate situations. As a missionary, you may be more aware of spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life. Resist the temptation to talk freely about these experiences. President Boyd K. Packer counseled: “I have learned that strong, impressive spiritual experiences do not come to us very frequently. And when they do, they are generally for our own edification, instruction, or correction. Unless we are called by proper authority to do so, they do not position us to counsel or to correct others. “I have come to believe also that it is not wise to continually talk of unusual spiritual experiences. They are to be guarded with care and shared only when the Spirit itself prompts you to use them to the blessing of others” (Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). “If worthy, we are entitled to receive revelations for ourselves, parents for their children, and members of the Church in their callings. But the right of revelation for others does not extend beyond our own stewardship.” – PRESIDENT JAMES E. FAUST “COMMUNION WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT,” ENSIGN, MAR. 2002, 4. #### Scripture Study (Page 113) Relying on the Spirit is so important that the Lord warns us very strongly not to deny or quench the Spirit. What do you learn from the following passages of scripture? - Jacob 6:8–9 3 Nephi 29:5–6 - Mormon 9:7–9 Moroni 10:7–8 - D&C 11:25–26 1 Thessalonians 5:19–20 #### Remember This (Page 113) - Pray with faith that your prayers will be answered. - Learn to understand, recognize, and follow the promptings of the Spirit. - Learn to rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Teach others how to recognize the Spirit. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 114) ### Personal Study (Page 114) - Record your spiritual experiences in your journal. For']","1 Nephi 4:6 emphasizes the importance of relying on the Spirit by illustrating how Nephi was guided by the Spirit to accomplish difficult tasks, such as retrieving the plates from Laban. In the broader context of missionary work and developing Christlike attributes, this scripture exemplifies how trusting in the Spirit can provide confidence and direction. The context highlights that missionaries are encouraged to use the Book of Mormon to confirm the truthfulness of the Restoration and to develop attributes like faith in Jesus Christ. Relying on the Spirit, as taught in the manual, is essential for guiding decisions, teaching effectively, and gaining spiritual confidence. Therefore, 1 Nephi 4:6 underscores that success in missionary efforts and spiritual development depends on trusting the Spirit to lead, inspire, and confirm truths, aligning with the themes of developing Christlike attributes and applying scriptural principles to one's service.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the page 67 information about resurrection and kingdoms of glory connect with the page 236 ideas for study and application about helping new converts and less-active members to stay on the path to eternal life and exaltation, especially considering the importance of understanding the doctrine of resurrection and the different kingdoms of glory?","['<1-hop>\n\nrighteousness and our guilt. If we have repented, we will receive mercy. We will be rewarded according to our works and our desires. Through the resurrection all people will become immortal—they will live forever. Immortality is a free gift to all people, whether they are righteous or wicked. Eternal life is not, however, the same as immortality. Eternal life is a gift of God given only to those who obey His gospel. It is the highest state that we can achieve. It comes to those who are freed from sin and suffering through the Atonement of Christ. It is exaltation, which means living with God forever in eternal families. It is to know God and Jesus Christ and to experience the life they enjoy. ### Resurrection and Reincarnation (Page 67) Some people may confuse the doctrine of resurrection with the concept of reincarnation. The concept of reincarnation involves being born into the world again in a different form and is false doctrine. The doctrine of resurrection involves receiving an eternal reward of an immortal body of flesh and bone. This is true doctrine. Make sure those you teach understand clearly the doctrine of the resurrection. > Lesson Two: Eighth Principle ## Kingdoms of Glory (Page 67) During our mortal lives we make choices regarding good and evil. God rewards us according to our works and desires. Because God rewards everyone according to deeds done in the body, there are different kingdoms of glory to which we may be assigned after the Judgment. Those who have repented of their sins and received the ordinances of the gospel and kept the associated covenants will be cleansed by the Atonement of Christ. They will receive exaltation in the highest kingdom, also known as the celestial kingdom. They will live in God’s presence, become like Him, and receive a fulness of joy. They will live together for eternity with those of their family who qualify. In the scriptures this kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun. People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars. #### Scripture Study (Page 68) - Resurrection and Restoration: 2 Nephi 9:14–15, Jacob 6:8–9,Alma 42:13–15, 22–23 - Judgment: 2 Nephi 28:23, Mosiah 3:23–25, Alma 5:15–21, Alma 12:12–14, D&C 132:12; 137:9 John 5:22 - Kingdoms of Glory: 3 Nephi 28:10, D&C 76: Introduction, D&C 76, D&C 137, Matthew 5:48, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40 - Eternal Life: 2 Nephi 31:17–21, D&C 14:7, D&C 29:43–44, D&C 45:8, D&C 93:19, John 3:16, John 17:3 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 68) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 69) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach.', '<2-hop>\n\nbeloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; . . . ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:19–20). Give your best efforts to help people qualify for “eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (D&C 14:7). #### Remember This (Page 235) - Build strong relationships with the bishop and members of the ward council. - Participate in appropriate ways during priesthood executive committee and ward council meetings. - Be of service to the ward council. When members of the council ask for your help: - Be willing to fellowship converts and less-active members, assist them in their callings and service opportunities, and reteach the missionary lessons. - With members, teach new converts the lesson “Laws and Ordinances.” ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 236) ### Personal Study (Page 236) - Using your daily planner, make plans to talk to new converts and recently activated members about changing their lives and attending church. What has helped them most? In your study journal, write your thoughts about their experiences. What have you learned that will help you in working with your current investigators? - Study 2 Nephi 31:18–20; Alma 26:1–7 and 32:32–43; and Moroni 6. Write what you learn from these verses about strengthening new converts. ### Companion Study (Page 236) - During ward council meeting, ask the bishop if there are any less-active members in your area he would like you to visit this week. As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ### Mission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for']","The page 67 content explains that the doctrine of resurrection involves receiving an immortal body and that there are different kingdoms of glory—celestial, terrestrial, and telestial—based on our choices and obedience.

The page 236 ideas for study and application highlight the importance of helping new converts and less-active members strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ and stay committed to the path leading to eternal life. Understanding the doctrine of resurrection and the kingdoms of glory is crucial because it provides a clear vision of the ultimate goals—living in God's presence and receiving eternal rewards—which can motivate and guide members in their spiritual journey.

How do 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians relate to the process of repentance and covenants in our spiritual journey?,"['<1-hop>\n\nfrom our sins and do them no more. We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper. Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son. Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions. In addition, we should continually improve—to develop Christlike qualities, to grow in knowledge, and to serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior expects of us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily. #### Scripture Study (Page 77) - We All Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:7–8 - Repentance: Alma 34:8–17, D&C 58:42–43, D&C 61:2, 2 Corinthians 7:9–10, Bible Dictionary, “Repentance” - Redemption and Forgiveness: Helaman 5:10–11 - Mercy Claims the Penitent: Alma 12:32–35, Alma 42:13, 21–24, D&C 18:10–13 > Lesson Three: Fourth Principle ## Baptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. #### Before Baptism (Page 78) “Ensure that [investigators] have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. Investigators should live the principles of moral worthiness, the Word of Wisdom, and commit to pay tithing. If missionaries feel additional preparation is needed, they should postpone baptism until the investigator meets the standard. *“Before baptism each investigator should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch president, and attend several sacrament meetings”* (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). #### Scripture Study (Page 79) - Christ’s Example: 2 Nephi 31:4–18, Matthew 3:13–17 - The Baptismal Covenant: Mosiah 5:8–10, Mosiah 18:8–10, D&C 20:37 - Qualifications', '<2-hop>\n\n### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 70) - Pre-Earth Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us - God is our Heavenly Father, and we are His children (see Acts 17:16–34; Hebrews 12:9). – God has a plan for our happiness. Jesus Christ is central to that plan. – God’s plan of happiness makes it possible to return to His presence (see Moses 1:39). – Our eternal progression depends on how we use our agency (see 2 Nephi 2:27–29). - The Creation – Under the Father’s direction, Jesus Christ created the earth (see Hebrews 1:1–3). - Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve – Adam and Eve were created in God’s image (see Genesis 1:26–27). – In the Garden of Eden they were innocent and lived in God’s presence. – Because they partook of the forbidden fruit, they were cast out of the garden (see Moses 4:19–31). This is called the Fall. – They became mortal, were able to have children, and were also subject to sin and death (see 2 Nephi 2:22–25; Moses 5:11). - Our Life on Earth – Our purpose in life is to find lasting peace, joy, and happiness as families and to prepare to return to live with God. – We came to the earth to be tested (see Abraham 3:24–25). – We gain a body of flesh and bones, but we are subject to physical death. – God gives commandments. If we obey, we are blessed. If we disobey, we sin and receive the consequences. – All sin must be paid for, either by ourselves or by Christ (see D&C 19:15–20). – We make choices, and we all commit sin (see Romans 3:23). – We have experiences that bring us happiness and also sorrow. – We cannot overcome either physical or spiritual death without Christ. - The Atonement – Because Jesus Christ overcame physical death, we will all be resurrected (see Alma 11:41–43). – Through Christ’s Atonement we can become clean from sin so that we can return to live in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 9:8–9). – Christ will forgive our sins as we have faith in Him, repent, receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. - The Spirit World – All people must die. – At death our spirits go to the spirit world. – We live in either a state of misery or a state of peace and rest, depending on how we lived in this life. - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality – Our spirits and bodies will be reunited in the resurrection (see Alma 11:42–45; 40:23). – We will return to God’s presence to be judged according to our works and desires. – If we have repented, we will receive mercy. – Eternal life is a gift of God given to those who fully obey the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 14:7). - Kingdoms of Glory (see D&C 76; 137; 1 Corinthians 15:40–42). – We receive rewards according to our works and desires (see D&C 137:9). – Those who receive the gospel and live it valiantly throughout their lives will receive the celestial kingdom (see D&C 76:50–70). – Honorable people who are “blinded by the craftiness of men” and who are “not valiant in the testimony of Jesus [Christ]” receive the terrestrial kingdom (see D&C 76:75, 79). – Those who sin and do not repent will receive the telestial glory after they suffer and pay for their sins. **Commitments** - Will you pray to know that what we have taught is true? - Will you repent of your sins? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","In the context of our spiritual journey, 1 Corinthians emphasizes the importance of repentance, forgiveness, and living Christlike lives, as seen in the references to repenting daily and developing Christlike qualities. 2 Corinthians highlights the significance of making and keeping covenants with God, such as baptism and the sacrament, which symbolize our commitment to follow Christ and receive His blessings.

How do the teachings about baptizm and the gospel of Jesus Christ from the first and second hop help the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints support new members?,"['<1-hop>\n\n- Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Be willing to take upon them the name of Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto a remission of their sins. 2. First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve: - Make sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. - Develop faith in Christ. - Repent of transgressions. - Live the principles of moral worthiness. - Live the Word of Wisdom. - Commit to pay tithing. - Receive all the missionary lessons [lessons 1–4 on the Teaching Record and associated commitments]. - Meet the bishop or branch president. - Attend several sacrament meetings. (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002) When an investigator has set a firm baptismal date, schedule when you will complete all the events that lead to baptism and confirmation as listed in your daily planner. Carefully review the Teaching Record to ensure that you have taught the basic doctrines and that the candidates are prepared to address each question in the baptismal interview. Review this schedule with the person in your next meeting. If possible, the person should attend a baptismal service prior to his or her own baptism. If you feel that the person you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule an interview until the investigator meets the standards. If the candidate is a minor, ensure that the parents or guardians have given permission, preferably in writing, for him or her to be baptized. As you help people prepare for their baptismal interview, talk to them about the purpose of the interview. Teach them and bear testimony about the sacredness of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Explain that you want to make sure they understand the principles you have taught and the covenant they will make. Also explain that the interview is an opportunity for them to witness before the Lord’s representative that they are ready for these sacred ordinances. As they keep the covenant made at baptism and confirmation, they will receive a remission of sins. Share the questions the interviewer will ask about their belief in important doctrines, their repentance of past sins, and their willingness to covenant to obey Jesus Christ throughout their lives. Emphasize that baptism by water is incomplete without confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 219) - Read each of the following passages, and make a summary list of the scriptural qualifications for baptism and confirmation. - 2 Nephi 9:23, 31:4-13; 3 Nephi 27:13-21, D&C 20:37 - Mosiah 18:8-10, Moroni 6:1-4, D&C 22 - Alma 7:14-15, Moroni 8:25-26, Acts 2:37-39 - In baptismal interviews, candidates are asked whether they are willing to take upon themselves the name of Christ. What can you do to help them understand this question? As you ponder this question, study the following scriptures: - Mosiah 4–5, Mosiah 18:1–11, Mosiah 26:18, 21–27; 3 Nephi 27:1–10 You may also want to look for other passages that help you understand this principle. ## How to Conduct the Interview (Page 219) The person conducting the interview should use the baptismal interview questions with the guidance of the Spirit to determine whether the baptismal candidate meets the qualifications described in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. He should also adapt the questions to the age and maturity of the candidate. If a candidate does not qualify according to the baptismal interview questions, the baptism and confirmation should be postponed. The investigator should receive additional teaching by the full-time missionaries and fellowshipping from ward members. The district leader or zone leader who conducts the interview should: - Hold the interview in a comfortable, private place, conducive to feeling the Spirit of the Lord. The interviewer’s companion should be nearby. - Open with prayer. - Help the candidate feel comfortable. - Make the interview a spiritually uplifting experience. - Make sure that the candidate understands the purpose of the interview. - Ask the baptismal interview questions. Use follow-up questions to get a feeling for the strength of the person’s testimony and the sincerity of the person’s repentance. - Answer the candidate’s questions. - Invite the person to bear testimony and express his or her feelings. - If the person has challenges with testimony or worthiness, explain that it would be best to postpone the baptism until he or she is better prepared. #### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 220) 1.

Offer to help. - Trust the Spirit to put into your heart and mind what to teach. - Invite everyone to learn about the restored gospel. - Offer pass-along cards. - Ask for the names of people’s acquaintances who might be interested in your message. As you read the following true account, look for how the man was prepared to receive the missionaries and how the missionaries used an unplanned opportunity to teach him the gospel. As a child, I was never taught to read the Bible. I went to church on Sundays, but I contributed nothing and felt nothing in return. I was disillusioned by my religion. . . . I searched for . . . God—wanting to know if He even existed. I thirsted to know Him and His words. But I could not seem to find what I sought. There were moments when I felt close to quenching my thirst. When I held my first child, a daughter, in my arms for the first time, I had a feeling that God really did exist. Many years later, when her sister was born, I experienced the same feeling. . . . Most of the time, however, an inexplicable tiredness weighed upon my soul. I was spiritually thirsty and could find no place to drink. In April 1994 I was living in the city of Monterrey, Mexico, earning a living as a taxi driver. One day it rained for hours, sending water cascading down the mountainsides. After driving around in the rain for hours, I found myself in a little town about eight kilometers (five miles) from Monterrey. It was about . . . nearly time to go home. Suddenly I saw two young men on foot. They were wearing dark trousers and white shirts, and they looked drenched from head to foot. When I approached them, I opened the door of the taxi and called, “Get in! I’m going to Monterrey.” The taller one, who had a very fair complexion, replied, “We don’t have any money.” “No charge,” I replied. They quickly got into the taxi. As I drove, we talked. They asked if they could share a message about Jesus Christ with me. I agreed and gave them my address. When I got home, I woke my wife and told her about the two young men. “What a coincidence,” I said. “One is Mexican and the other is American, and they are both named Elder.” “Elder means missionary,” my wife answered, knowing just a little about the Church. From deep within me, I felt something stir. These young men had left a feeling of exquisite wonder in my heart. I felt that I was close to finding the water that would quench my thirst, that it was within reach. The missionaries came to our home on 5 June, and I was happy to listen to them. Two weeks later, on 19 June, I was baptized. My wife was baptized four months later, in October. Our oldest daughter had been receiving religious training at a school. When she went to church for the first time, she cried, “Papa, this is so much better than what I am learning at school!” She too was baptized in October. In December 1995 we were sealed as a family in the Mexico City Mexico Temple for this life and for eternity. Now we are a family enjoying harmony, peace, and happiness. We know who we worship. We know where we came from and where we are going. We love God’s word, especially the Book of Mormon, and we love His Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Through these gifts we have found that well of living water the Savior spoke of to the woman of Samaria: “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:14). [Victor Manuel Cabrera, “Thirsting for the Living Water,” Ensign, Aug. 2001, 60–61] #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 172) - How had the man been prepared for the restored gospel? - What would have happened if the elders had never opened their mouths to share a gospel message? - Review what you did yesterday. Did you talk with as many people as possible? If not, make plans and set goals to do so today. #### Scripture study (Page 172) What does the Lord say about opening your mouth? What should you teach? What are you promised? - D&C 24:12, D&C 28:16, D&C 33:7–15, D&C 60:2–3, 7–8 ## Teach When You Find, Find When You Teach (Page 172) Finding and teaching are related, connected activities. When you meet people, be prepared to teach brief summaries of restored truth so that the Holy Ghost can bear witness that you are the servants of the Lord. In many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to . . .""* If a little more time is available, you might say more: *""Our message is simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us.']","The first hop emphasizes the spiritual qualifications and preparations necessary for baptism, such as repentance, faith in Christ, and understanding the principles of the gospel, which align with the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about living worthy to receive ordinances. The second hop illustrates how personal experiences and the Spirit prepare individuals to accept the restored gospel, highlighting the importance of sharing the message and inviting others to learn about Christ. Together, these teachings support the church's mission by guiding new members through spiritual readiness and emphasizing the role of personal testimony and outreach in strengthening their faith and adherence to church standards.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
