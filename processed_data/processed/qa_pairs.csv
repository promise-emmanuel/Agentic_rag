There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ##']",Moses 1:39 is significant in missionary work as it highlights the purpose of missionaries in helping 'to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.'
How can missionaries help others come unto Christ according to the missionary lessons?,"['The Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ##']","Missionaries can help others come unto Christ by teaching lessons that focus on faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. The lessons should be flexible and tailored to the needs of the investigator, guided by the Spirit, and should not exceed 45 minutes."
Wht is the role of 'Jesus the Christ' in personal study?,"['Personal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes), and prepare for the day. - 7:30 a.m. Breakfast. - 8:00 a.m. Personal study: the Book of Mormon, other scriptures, doctrines of the missionary lessons, other chapters from Preach My Gospel, the Missionary Handbook, and the Missionary Health Guide. - 9:00 a.m. Companion study: share what you have learned during personal study, prepare to teach, practice teaching, study chapters from Preach My Gospel, confirm plans for the day. - 10:00 a.m. Begin proselyting. Missionaries learning a language study that language for an additional 30 to 60 minutes, including planning language learning activities to use during the day. Missionaries may take an hour for lunch and additional study, and an hour for dinner at times during the day that fit best with their proselyting. Normally dinner should be finished no later than 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. Return to living quarters (unless teaching a lesson; then return by 9:30) and plan the next day’s activities (30 minutes). Write in journal, prepare for bed, pray. - 10:30 p.m. Retire to bed. \\*In consultation with the Presidency of the Seventy or the Area Presidency, your mission president may modify this schedule to meet local circumstances. What you learn in personal study will help you in companion study, district meeting, and zone conferences, where you can “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). What you gain from your study sessions and district meetings will help you teach with spiritual power. ### Personal Study (page 10) The purpose of personal study is to strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. In your personal study, focus on the standard works and the approved missionary library: - Jesus the Christ - Our Heritage - Our Search for Happiness - True to the Faith You can make personal study effective as you: - Read from the Book of Mormon and other scriptures. - Study the doctrines of the missionary lessons. - Study other chapters from Preach My Gospel. ### Companion Study (Page 11) The purpose of companion study is to (1) build unity in your companionship in order to teach by the Spirit and (2) focus on the progress of those you teach. You can make companion study effective as you: - Share insights with each other from personal study. - Prepare for specific teaching appointments, member visits, finding opportunities, and other activities. Study material that helps you teach, find, and work more effectively. Discuss the people with whom you are working. Make plans to apply what you are learning. - Throughout the day, continue to discuss the principles, goals, skills, and plans from companion study. ### District Meetings (Page 11) The purpose of district meeting is to “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). - District meetings are held each week for 60 to 90 minutes. - The district leader plans and conducts the district meeting and may invite other missionaries to help teach. - District meetings may include: – Sharing insights from personal and companion study. – Practicing the lessons in various settings. – Explaining, demonstrating, and practicing principles and skills described in Preach My Gospel. – Discussing the progress and needs of investigators. – Discussing and addressing challenges in the district. – Sharing experiences and testimonies of missionary work. - District leaders may use district meeting to receive reports regarding the efforts of missionaries in the district. They should not set goals or quotas for other missionaries.']","In personal study, 'Jesus the Christ' is part of the approved missionary library that helps strengthen knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel and prepares missionaries to meet the needs of those they teach."
What districts do in mission work?,"['### Zone Conferences (Page 11) Zone conferences are held under the direction of the mission president. ### Study Journal (Page 12) Preach My Gospel frequently asks that you use a study journal to help you understand, clarify, and remember what you are learning. Elder Richard G. Scott taught, “Knowledge carefully recorded is knowledge available in time of need. Spiritually sensitive information should be kept in a sacred place that communicates to the Lord how you treasure it. This practice enhances the likelihood of your receiving further light” (“Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge,” Ensign, Nov. 1993, 86). Review your study journal to recall spiritual experiences, see new insights, and recognize your growth. Your study journal may be a bound journal, a notebook, or a binder. Record and organize your thoughts and impressions in a way that fits how you learn. Develop your own system to easily access key information in the future. Use it often to review, access, and apply what you have learned. Use your study journal to take notes and record impressions during your personal and companion study, district meetings, zone conferences, and interviews with the mission president. ### Ideas for Study and Application (Page 13) Each chapter concludes with additional ideas for personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. This rich resource of learning activities provides examples of effective ways to learn the material. Be creative and seek inspiration to create additional activities each time you study or teach one of these sections. Complete these activities several times during your mission. ## Missionaries Serving in Branches and Districts (Page 13) Many missionaries serve in branches and districts. Although this manual refers to wards and stakes, the same principles and approaches apply to branches and districts. The mission president will instruct you on any adjustments to make when working with branch and district leaders. ##']","Many missionaries serve in branches and districts.

How can 'Preach My Gospel' be utilized by ward missionaries and leaders to support their responsibilities and foster unity with full-time missionaries?,"['Use by Ward Missionaries and Leaders (Page 13) Preach My Gospel is for the full-time missionaries of the Church. However, the principles and doctrines taught herein are also applicable to ward missionaries and leaders as they seek to build the Lord’s kingdom. Frequent study of this manual will enable them to fulfill their responsibilities as member missionaries and will foster unity with the full-time missionaries. > Beginning of Chapter 1 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Is My Purpose as a Missionary? (Page 15) ## Your Purpose (Page 15) Invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ### Consider This (Page 15) - What is my purpose as a missionary? - What is the gospel? - Why do we preach the gospel? - Why must I teach with power and authority? - What is the message of the Restoration? Why is it so important? - What is my responsibility in helping others become converted? - How will I know whether I am a successful missionary? > Questions to help study this chapter by looking for the answers ## Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 15) You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. All of them are children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (D&C 59:23), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of guilt that come from mistakes and sins. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (2 Nephi 2:6, 8). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, Title Page). As your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great . . . importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (2 Nephi 2:8). President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world. That is the cause that must unite us today. Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167). You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. To come to the Savior they must have faith in Him unto repentance— making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenants of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19).']","'Preach My Gospel' is primarily for the full-time missionaries of the Church, but the principles and doctrines it contains are also applicable to ward missionaries and leaders. By frequently studying this manual, ward missionaries and leaders can fulfill their responsibilities as member missionaries and foster unity with the full-time missionaries. This study helps them build the Lord’s kingdom and align their efforts with those of the full-time missionaries."
How does the message in Romans 1:16 relate to the teaching of the gospel by the Spirit?,"['### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11. In this vision, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God (see 1 Nephi 11:21–22). - In the vision, what did the people need to do to be able to partake of the fruit? What do we need to do to receive all the blessings of the Atonement? In what ways do commitments and covenants help us partake of these blessings? - As a missionary, what is your duty in helping others find and partake of the fruits of the gospel? - What did Lehi desire after he had eaten the fruit? (See 1 Nephi 8:10–18.) ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 17) The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for families: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ##']","Romans 1:16 states that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the 'power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.' This emphasizes the necessity of teaching the message of the Restoration of the gospel by divine power, specifically through the Holy Ghost, who is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others."
What D&C 79:1 say about missionary work?,"['The Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power? Study Alma 17:2–3, D&C 53:3, 1 Corinthians 2:4 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 19) Look at the painting of Christ ordaining the Apostles, and then read John 15:1–16. - In what way is Christ the vine? How are you a branch of that vine? How does your setting apart relate to this relationship? - Read again your ministerial certificate. Record your feelings and thoughts about what you read. Each time you study this chapter, repeat this process. Note how your feelings change over time. - Study Doctrine and Covenants 109:13–15, 21–30, 38–39, 55–57, which are excerpts from the Prophet Joseph Smith’s inspired dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple. What blessings did Joseph Smith request for the faithful?']","D&C 79:1 states that missionaries are to go 'in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel.'"
Wht does 2 Nephi say abot the gospel of Jesus Christ?,"['The Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 19) The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work. The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will, and His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. ####']","2 Nephi 31:10–21 is referenced in the context as a comparison to 3 Nephi 27:13–22, which discusses the gospel of Jesus Christ, including faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end."
What 2 Nephi 31:10–21 say about gospel of Christ?,"['Scripture Study (Page 20) What is the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ? - Read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27:13–22 for answers to the question. ##']","To understand the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ, one should read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, along with other scriptures like 3 Nephi 11:31–41 and 3 Nephi 27:13–22."
How does Moroni 10:3–5 play a role in helping individuals gain a spiritual confirmation of the Restoration of the gospel?,"['The Message of the Restoration: The Foundation of Faith (Page 20) No matter where you serve or whom you teach, center your teaching on the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ of the gospel of Jesus Christ. “The Lord will bless you as you teach the message of the Restoration to a world that desperately needs the gospel of Jesus Christ” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you study the doctrines in the missionary lessons, you will come to see that we have one message: Through a modern prophet, God has restored knowledge about the plan of salvation, which is centered on Christ’s Atonement and fulfilled by living the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Make sure that everyone you teach clearly understands the following: - God is our literal Father in Heaven. He loves us. Every person on earth is a child of God and a member of God’s family. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior and Redeemer. - Our loving Father in Heaven reached out to His children throughout biblical history by revealing His gospel to prophets. Sadly, many people rejected that gospel; even some of those who accepted it changed gospel doctrines and ordinances and fell into unbelief and apostasy. - Our Father in Heaven sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. He performed miracles and taught His gospel. He accomplished the Atonement and was resurrected. - Beginning with the First Vision, God has again reached out in love to His children. He restored the gospel of Jesus Christ and His priesthood authority and organized His Church on the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence of this Restoration. As you help investigators see the pattern of apostasy and restoration, they will be prepared to understand the great need for the latter-day Restoration. They will see the need to accept the restored gospel, receive the ordinances of salvation by the authority of the restored priesthood, and follow the way to eternal life. Help people recognize that the Church is not just another religion, nor is it an American church. Rather, it is a restoration of the “fulness of [the] gospel” (D&C 1:23), the same as was revealed and taught from the beginning. The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. It is the keystone of our religion, the most powerful resource for teaching this message. Some important truths restored through Joseph Smith include the knowledge that God is our Father and that we are His spirit children, that we lived with Him before birth, and that families can live together forever in God’s presence through Christ’s Atonement by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel. The Book of Mormon is evidence of the love of God for His children. It shows that God speaks to His children. As you teach and testify, invite people to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its message. Each person you teach must decide whether to accept the Book of Mormon as revelation from God. Trust the remarkable promise in Moroni 10:3–5. Do all you can to persuade people to read the book, understand it, and ask God sincerely whether it is true. The witness of the Holy Ghost becomes the cornerstone of their faith that Christ has restored His Church. Help those you teach to receive that spiritual confirmation. ####']","Moroni 10:3–5 contains a remarkable promise that encourages individuals to read the Book of Mormon, understand its message, and sincerely ask God whether it is true. This process is crucial for gaining a spiritual confirmation through the witness of the Holy Ghost, which becomes the cornerstone of their faith that Christ has restored His Church."
How can 1 Nephi 13:39 be utilized in missionary work to emphasize the importance of the Book of Mormon and its role in the Restoration?,"['Scripture Study (Page 22) How should you use the Book of Mormon in your missionary work? - Read 1 Nephi 13:39 2 Nephi 29:8–10, Moroni 10:3–5 D&C 20:5–16, D&C 42:12–14 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 22) Imagine that you are going to write an article about the message of the Restoration for a local newspaper. In your study journal write a title that describes the central message. Then record your thoughts and feelings about this message, including how understanding it better has changed the way you live and the way you view the world around you. ## Helping Others Make Commitments: The Door to Faith and Repentance (Page 22) Help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “The first thing you will do when an investigator tells you he or she had not read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! . . . Much of the time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the balance. . . . It is the most important path this investigator will ever walk. But if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! . . . So take control of this situation. Teach with power and authority, and then be devastated if the first steps toward commandment-keeping and covenant-keeping have not been successfully begun” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1997).']","1 Nephi 13:39 can be used in missionary work to highlight the significance of the Book of Mormon as a key component of the Restoration. By reading this scripture, missionaries can help others understand the divine purpose and truth of the Book of Mormon, encouraging them to read and pray about it. This understanding is crucial as it prepares individuals to make and keep sacred covenants, building their faith in Jesus Christ and leading them towards baptism and confirmation."
What are the qualifications for baptism according to Doctrine and Covenants 20:37?,"['As you teach people to understand the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel, you “declare repentance” (D&C 15:6). Repentance involves a change of heart and a desire to forsake sin and serve God. It involves humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to God’s will. It requires that people increase their commitment to live in agreement with God’s will. Repentance requires a sincere and lasting change of thoughts, desires, habits, and actions. It is a positive experience that brings joy and peace. Be bold and loving in helping people understand what they must do to repent. By inviting people to make commitments, you can effectively raise a voice of both warning and hope. #### Scripture Study (Page 22) What do these scriptures teach about declaring repentance? - Read Alma 29:1–4 Alma 42:31, Alma 62:45 D&C 14:8, and D&C 15:6; 16:6 for answersto the question. ## Baptism and Confirmation (Page 23) Baptizing and confirming the people you teach is central to your purpose. Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost brings a host of blessings to those who live worthy of it. Through these ordinances people enter the gate and continue on the path to eternal life. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said: “We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church. We do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives. . . . We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the sons and daughters of God. No one else can do this” (“The Purpose of Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1995). As you teach the restored gospel, help people understand the sacred nature of baptism and confirmation. Help them realize that receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is a great blessing in this life and a key to their salvation. The Holy Ghost will “teach [them] all things” (John 14:26). President Boyd K. Packer taught: “When you are teaching investigators and preparing them for baptism by water, you must also think of the gift of the Holy Ghost— baptism by fire. Think of it as one sentence. First comes the baptism of water and then the baptism of fire” (“The Gift of the Holy Ghost: What Every Missionary Should Know—and Every Member As Well,” seminar for new mission presidents, June 2003). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 5:499). Help those you teach understand that to qualify for baptism and confirmation they must meet the conditions given in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. ### D&C 20:37 Qualifications for Baptism (page 23) - Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Are willing to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins. After worthy converts are baptized, they are confirmed members of the Church and the gift of the Holy Ghost is conferred upon them. This confirmation occurs under the direction of the bishop or branch president in a sacrament meeting soon after the baptism. While the two ordinances are separated by a brief time, confirmation complements and completes baptism. ####']","According to Doctrine and Covenants 20:37, the qualifications for baptism include humbling oneself before God, desiring to be baptized, coming forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, repenting of all sins, being willing to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve Christ to the end, and manifesting by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins."
What does John 14:26 say about the Holy Ghost?,"['Scripture Study (Page 24) 1. In what ways is the gift of the Holy Ghost one of the greatest gifts we can receive? - Read 3 Nephi 19:1–13, D&C 45:56–57, John 3:5, John 14:26, Galatians 5:22–25, and Topical Guide: “Holy Ghost, Gift of” for answers to the question. 2. Why should converts desire the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Read 2 Nephi 31:12–17, 2 Nephi 32:1–5, Acts 8:14–17 and Acts 19:1–6 for answers to the question. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 24) Search the following scriptures and make a list of the qualifications and covenant of baptism. Discuss with your companion how to teach those requirements to others. - 2 Nephi 31:13 Mosiah 18:8–10 - Alma 7:14–16 3 Nephi 11:21–41 - Moroni 6:1–4 D&C 20:37 ## Establishing the Church (Page 24) When people have been baptized and confirmed members of the Church, continue to work with ward leaders and members to help these new converts adjust to their new life and continue their spiritual growth. The Church is established as people who have testimonies are baptized and confirmed, keep their covenants, prepare actively to go to the temple, and help strengthen the ward or branch. Converts who have member friends, who are given responsibility, and who are nourished by God’s word will grow in testimony and faith. Missionaries, ward leaders, and Church members should not turn away from their responsibility to nourish and strengthen new members.']",The context suggests reading John 14:26 to understand the role of the Holy Ghost as one of the greatest gifts we can receive.
How does the scripture in Helaman 10:3–5 illustrate the Lord's feelings towards missionaries and their service?,"['## A Successful Missionary (Page 24) Your success as a missionary is measured primarily by your commitment to find, teach, baptize, and confirm people and to help them become faithful members of the Church who enjoy the presence of the Holy Ghost. Avoid comparing yourself to other missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts against theirs. Remember that people have agency to choose whether to accept your message. Your responsibility is to teach clearly and powerfully so they can make a correct choice. Some may not accept your message even when they have received a spiritual witness that it is true. You will be saddened because you love them and desire their salvation. You should not, however, become discouraged; discouragement will weaken your faith. If you lower your expectations, your effectiveness will decrease, your desire will weaken, and you will have greater difficulty following the Spirit. You can know you have been a successful missionary when you: - Feel the Spirit testify to people through you. - Love people and desire their salvation. - Obey with exactness. - Live so that you can receive and know how to follow the Spirit, who will show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Develop Christlike attributes. - Work effectively every day, do your very best to bring souls to Christ, and seek earnestly to learn and improve. - Help build up the Church (the ward) wherever you are assigned to work. - Warn people of the consequences of sin. Invite them to make and keep commitments. - Teach and serve other missionaries. - Go about doing good and serving people at every opportunity, whether or not they accept your message. When you have done your very best, you may still experience disappointments, but you will not be disappointed in yourself. You can feel certain that the Lord is pleased when you feel the Spirit working through you. #### Scripture Study (Page 25) How do servants of the Lord feel about the work? How do servants of the Lord influence those they serve? - Read Mosiah 28:3, Alma 8:14–15, Helaman 10:3–5, 3 Nephi 28:4–10, Ether 12:13–15, D&C 15:4–6, D&C 16:4–6 and D&C 68:2–6 for the answers to the questions. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 25) - Read Helaman 10:1–5 and 3 Nephi 7:17–18. How did the Lord feel about these missionaries and their service? - Think about the missionary efforts of Abinadi and Ammon (see Mosiah 11–18; Alma 17–20, 23–24). Why were both missionaries successful even though the immediate results of their efforts were different? - Record what you learn in your study journal. ### Remember This (Page 25) - Your purpose is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. - The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way by which we can find eternal happiness. - Your calling gives you authority; keeping your covenants gives you power. - The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. - You help people live the gospel by inviting them to make and keep commitments. - You show your love for the Lord and gratitude for His Atonement by bringing souls unto Him. - You are successful when you are obedient, live righteously, and do your best in helping others live the gospel. ##']",The scripture in Helaman 10:3–5 is suggested for study to understand how the Lord feels about missionaries and their service. It is part of a broader set of scriptures that provide insights into the feelings and influence of the Lord's servants in their work.
"What did Brigham Young say about the mission of individuals in the Church, and how can this perspective be used to encourage missionaries to keep study journals for personal growth and effective teaching?","['Missionary Work (Page 26) Following are statements made by Presidents of the Church in this dispensation. ### President Joseph Smith (1830–1844) (Page 26) “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 113). “Let the Saints remember that great things depend on their individual exertion, and that they are called to be co-workers with us and the Holy Spirit in accomplishing the great work of the last days” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 178–79). ### President Brigham Young (1847–1877) (Page 26) “There is neither man or woman in this Church who is not on a mission. That mission will last as long as they live, and it is to do good, to promote righteousness, to teach the principles of truth, and to prevail upon themselves and everybody around them to live those principles that they may obtain eternal life” (Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 322). ### President John Taylor (1880–1887) (Page 26) “Our duty is to preach the gospel to all men. . . . This is what God expects of us” (The Gospel Kingdom, sel. G. Homer Durham [1943], 234–35). ### President Wilford Woodruff (1889–1898) (Page 26) “We have come to this earth upon a mission; . . . that we may have power to go forth and warn the nations of the earth. . . . As elders of Israel, very few of us fully comprehend our position, our calling, our relationship to God, our responsibility, our work the Lord requires at our hands” (The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, sel. G. Homer Durham [1946], 124). ### President Lorenzo Snow (1898–1901) (Page 26) “There is no mortal man that is so much interested in the success of an elder when he is preaching the gospel as the Lord that sent him to preach to the people who are the Lord’s children” (The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow, comp.

"What role does Alma play in helping others increase their faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation according to the context provided?","['## Ideas for Study and Application (page 28) ### Personal Study (Page 28) - Prepare a two-minute talk on one of the questions at the beginning of this chapter. Be prepared to share your talk with your companion or with other missionaries in a district meeting. - Ask recent converts to tell their conversion stories. What helped them gain “faith unto repentance” (Alma 34:17)? Why did they decide to be baptized and confirmed? What was it like for them to become new members of the Church? How could missionaries have served them better? - Consider what it means to raise the voice of warning (see Jacob 3:12; D&C 1:4; 38:41; 63:57–58; 88:81; 112:5; Ezekiel 3:17–21; 33:1–12). Write in your own words what it means and how you can go about doing it. - Read Mormon 8 and Moroni 1 and 10. As you read, ask yourself, “What was Moroni’s hope for our day? What did he want us to do with the Book of Mormon? What would I say to Moroni if I had the chance?” Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Consider the events in your life that have strengthened your testimony of Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Then write an answer to this question: What has helped you know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith? ### Companion Study (Page 28) - Share with each other your answers to the questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. - Share with each other what your hopes and desires were for your mission when you received your mission call. To what extent does your experience thus far meet your expectations? How can you meet these expectations more fully? - Read and discuss “Ministry” in the Bible Dictionary. - Select one of the following great missionaries, and read the references listed. As you read, discuss how this missionary (1) understood and committed himself to his calling, (2) demonstrated his attitude and desire for the work, and (3) helped others accept the gospel. - Alma (Mosiah 18) - Aaron (Alma 22; 23:1–6) - Nephi and Lehi (Helaman 5) - Peter (Acts 2) - Paul (Acts 16) - In the hymnbook, select two hymns under the topic “Restoration of the Gospel” (see page 424). Read or sing the hymns. Discuss the meaning of the words. - Read together “Faith,” “Repentance,” “Baptism,” and “Holy Ghost” in the Bible Dictionary. Read and discuss all the scripture references in each entry. - Read together “Dispensations” in the Bible Dictionary. Also read and discuss Doctrine and Covenants 136:37. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 29) - Invite two or three recent converts to share their conversion experiences. How did they feel about the missionaries? about what the missionaries taught? about keeping commitments? What most strongly influenced their conversion? - Invite a priesthood leader to talk to the missionaries about the opportunities and difficulties of building the Church in your area. - Read Alma 18 and discuss these questions: What were Lamoni’s feelings at the beginning of the story? How did they change? What feelings must a person have in order to receive the blessings of the gospel? Read Alma 34:15–16, and compare it with Lamoni’s story. How does Christ’s Atonement enable us to obtain mercy? - Discuss what it means to be a successful missionary. Invite missionaries to give specific examples of success. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Assign one group to read Acts 2:36–38 (Peter), another group to read Acts 16:25–33 (Paul), and the final group to read Mosiah 18:8–11 (Alma). Ask each group to answer the question, “What did this missionary do to help others increase in faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation?” Discuss what the missionaries learn from these stories that could help them exercise faith when inviting people to repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. - Several days before the meeting, assign several missionaries to ponder selected questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. Ask each missionary to prepare a two- to three-minute talk on his or her assigned question. During the district meeting or zone conference, allow the missionaries to give their talks. Following the talks, discuss what they learned and how they could use it in their missionary work. - Divide the missionaries into four groups. Ask each group to list as many truths, covenants, and ordinances as they can that were restored and revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Have each group share their results. Invite missionaries to share how any of the truths revealed through the Restoration has influenced their lives. ###']","In the context provided, Alma is highlighted as a great missionary whose actions are studied to understand how he helped others increase their faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation.

How does Matthew 5:6 relate to effective gospel study?,"['Mission President (Page 29) 1. During interviews, periodically ask missionaries to share with you: – Their testimony of Jesus Christ. – Their testimony of the restored gospel and the mission of Joseph Smith. – Their testimony of the Book of Mormon. – Their thoughts about their purpose as a missionary. 2.

Send a letter of congratulations to new members. > Beginning of Chapter 2 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach? (Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns.']","Matthew 5:6, which speaks of 'hungering and thirsting after righteousness,' relates to effective gospel study by emphasizing the need for a strong desire to learn and study with real intent."
How does learnin' 'bout Jesus Christ help us in our gospel study and life?,"['#### Activity: Personal Study (Page 32) Read Joseph Smith—History 1:11–13. Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior.

How can D&C 84:85 guide a Latter-day Saint Family Counselor in preparing to teach gospel principles effectively?,"['Studying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain the baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). ####']","D&C 84:85 advises that teachers should rely on the Spirit to guide them in what to say, ensuring that their teaching is clear, simple, and tailored to individual needs. This aligns with the guidance for Latter-day Saint Family Counselors to thoroughly understand lessons, teach by the Spirit, and focus on helping others strengthen their faith and make commitments. By following the Spirit, counselors can effectively teach gospel principles and help families grow spiritually."
Wht is the purpse of using the Bible Dictionary in study journals?,"['Defining Words (Page 35) We have a powerful message with a unique vocabulary. Just as a physician speaks differently in the family waiting room than in the operating room, so too must you learn to speak so that those who are unfamiliar with our message can understand what you are teaching.

Use True to the Faith and the Bible Dictionary to find definitions for other words. Write these definitions in your study journal. Share the definitions with your companion and others to see if you understand. If the definitions are unclear to others, revise your definitions based on the material you have studied. As you teach, seek to discern whether a word or principle is new to the person you are teaching. Take time to explain unfamiliar words or principles. Remember to teach for understanding so that you and those you teach “are edified and rejoice together” (D&C 50:22). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 35) Turn to the lesson “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ” located in chapter 3. Read the list of key definitions in the “Ideas for Teaching” section. Locate three other words in the lesson that you would like to define.

Consider the following as you plan your study: - Always begin with a prayer. - Plan study activities that will build your faith in the Savior and use your time productively. - Plan your study around people, their needs, and preparing them for baptism, confirmation, and enduring to the end. Note your study plans in your daily planner. - Plan your study by asking: What will I be teaching today? How can I plan my study to best help those I teach? Which ideas and suggestions from this section will I incorporate in my study? As you plan your study activities, experiment with some of the ideas and suggestions that follow or with additional ideas you learn from others. ### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals.']","The purpose of using the Bible Dictionary in study journals is to find definitions for unfamiliar words, which can then be written in the journal to aid understanding and teaching. This helps ensure that both the teacher and those being taught can understand and be edified by the message."
How can Latter-day Saints (LDS) improve their personal study habits according to the guidelines provided?,"['### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ###']","Latter-day Saints can improve their personal study habits by being alert, exercising, showering, and praying before studying.

How do you use the Bible for study and understanding?,"['See the Big Picture (Page 37) - Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background. - Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph. - Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain. - Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 37) Read the chapter summaries of the books below and write an outline that describes the setting, main events, and main doctrines of each book. - 1 Nephi - Moses - Acts ### Explore the Details (Page 38) - Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions. Examine surrounding words or phrases for clues to what the key words mean. - Look for connecting words, such as therefore, and again, thus, wherefore, and others. Then see how the preceding and following passages relate to each other. - Use the Topical Guide to see how the same word is used in other contexts or how other prophets use the same word. - Look for unfamiliar words or phrases and make sure you understand them. ### Marking Scriptures (Page 38) Marking your scriptures can assist you in thinking deeply about a passage or doctrine of the gospel. You can mark your scriptures in many ways. Find a method that works for you. Below are some guidelines for marking scriptures. - Use pencils or colored markers. Avoid using pens that bleed through the paper. - Shade, underline, bracket, or outline part of a verse, an entire verse, or a group of verses. - Avoid excessive marking. The benefit is lost if you cannot understand your markings because you have made too many notes, lines, and colors. - Underline only a few key words to highlight the verse, section, or chapter. - Circle or underline key words, and then use straight lines to link closely related words. - When a series of points in a verse or passage are related, number the points in the margin or text. - Use the footnotes as a resource for marking and interpreting the scriptures. - Place a symbol (such as a check mark) in the margin for key verses you feel are critical to remember. Marking your scriptures should help you focus on applying what you learn and on teaching others. Develop an approach that is consistent and helps you accomplish your purpose as a missionary. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 38) Which suggestions have you not yet tried? Identify one suggestion from “Study Ideas and Suggestions” to try during your next personal or companion study session. #### Remember This (Page 38) - Pursuing the desire to learn is important to your salvation and your success as a missionary. - You learn the gospel by study, faith, and the power of the Holy Ghost. - Learning is a joy and brings many blessings. - Daily personal and companion study strengthens your faith and your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Use a variety of study methods that make the experience meaningful and enjoyable. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 39) ### Personal Study (Page 39) 1. Rate yourself on the following (1=never, 3=some of the time, and 5=almost always). - I think about the people I am teaching when I study. - Throughout the day I think about what I studied in the morning. - As I study, ideas come to my mind that have not occurred to me before. - I record spiritual impressions and ideas in an appropriate place. - I fall asleep as I study. - I look forward to personal study. - I look forward to companion study.

What you think about Sermon on the Mount and how it help missionaries teach gospel?,"['District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 40) 1. Select a topic from one of the missionary lessons that you have carefully studied. Do the following: – Share two or three main points you learned from your study that were helpful in teaching that lesson. – Describe the way you approached your study that helped you discover these points (how you read, resources you used, questions you were researching, and so on). – Show how you recorded and organized the results of your study. If time permits, ask a few other missionaries to do the same. 2. This activity may be done individually or in small groups. Instruct the missionaries to select one of the following questions (or you may create some of your own questions). Have them write the question down. – Why are families so important in God’s plan? – Why do people have trials and suffering? – What is the role of the Spirit in conversion? Explain that they will have five to seven minutes to: – Find at least two scripture references that answer the question. – Write a simple interpretation of how the scriptures they chose answer the question. – Describe what they would do to remember the answer. – Describe what they would do to explore the question more deeply. Invite a few missionaries (or each group) to share their answers. Discuss their responses. 3. Ask the missionaries to write one or two questions about the gospel principles and doctrines from one of the lessons in chapter 3 for which they would like to find an answer. Invite the missionaries to share their questions with the group. For each question, discuss the following: – How will answering this question bless the life of the missionary? – How will it bless the lives of investigators? – How could a missionary find the answer? 4. Ask several missionaries to share a gospel principle that their companions have taught them. Ask them to explain the principle and how their companion taught it to them. 5. Organize missionaries into companionships or small groups. Assign each group to read one chapter from the Book of Mormon.

Allow 15 to 20 minutes for reading and discussion. Have each group explain the suggestions they used, how well the suggestions worked, and what they learned. 6. Invite each missionary to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to him or her (such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites). Invite the missionaries to sketch or describe how they visualize the accounts they have chosen. Invite two or three missionaries to share what they visualize. Ask others to tell the stories and relate them to doctrines in one of the lessons. Read Moroni 10:3 and discuss the value of pondering deeply about spiritual knowledge. ###']","Missionaries are invited to think of stories or events in the scriptures, such as the Sermon on the Mount, that have meaning to them.

How should a Latter-day Saint Family Counselor approach teaching the essential doctrines of Jesus Christ to ensure spiritual growth and commitment before and after baptism?,"['What Do I Study and Teach? (Page 43) The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrines, principles, and commandments that you are to study, believe, love, live, and teach. They are what the living prophets and apostles have directed you to teach. They are organized so that you can help others clearly understand the doctrines of Christ. The lessons in this chapter are: 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 2. The Plan of Salvation 3. The Gospel of Jesus Christ 4. The Commandments 5. Laws and Ordinances Teach the first four lessons before baptism. Make sure those you teach qualify for baptism and confirmation by making and keeping all of the commitments in these lessons. Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching lessons before baptism with the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, new members are taught the first four lessons again, as well as “Laws and Ordinances.” Ward leaders determine whether ward missionaries or full-time missionaries lead out in ensuring that these lessons are taught and how long full-time missionaries are involved. Encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons. You should also use these lessons in individual and companion study, district meetings, and other training settings. As you study the scriptures and treasure up in your mind the doctrines in these lessons, the Spirit will give you in the very hour what you should say and do to help others receive a witness of the truthfulness of the teachings. As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and prepare to teach, keep firmly in mind these instructions. Make sure that you teach all the doctrines in these lessons. Unless directed by the Spirit, for each of the first three lessons, you should give the full content in the order in which they are written. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Each lesson outlines the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrines that you are to teach. Thoroughly learn the doctrines. Consistently focus on helping those you teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview questions to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation. The lessons also have ideas for teaching. Use these suggestions to strengthen how you prepare and teach. ###']","A Latter-day Saint Family Counselor should approach teaching the essential doctrines of Jesus Christ by focusing on the lessons outlined in the chapter, which include the Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Plan of Salvation, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Commandments.

Why is it important to study D&C 84:85 in the context of missionary lessons?,"['The Role of Memorization (Page 44) Memorize scriptures to use in your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal points in each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language should focus their language study on preparing to teach the missionary lessons. They should memorize vocabu- lary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons. ### Teach with Clarity (Page 44) At the end of the first three lessons is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to make the message easy to understand. ### Scripture Study (Page 44) What are you directed to teach?

We are His children. He has a body of flesh and bone that is glorified and perfected. He loves us. He weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right. He wants to communicate with us, and we can communicate with Him through sincere prayer. He has given us this experience on the earth so we can learn and grow. We can show our love for Him through our choices and our obedience to His commandments. Heavenly Father has provided us, His children, with a way to be successful in this life and to return to live in His presence. However, we must be pure and clean through obedience in order to do so. Disobedience moves us away from Him. Central to our Father’s plan is Jesus Christ’s Atonement. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane as well as His suffering and death on the cross. Through the Atonement we can be freed from the burden of our sins and develop faith and strength to face our trials. ### Belief about God (Page 46) Determine what each person you are teaching understands regarding Christian beliefs about God. Many people in today’s world either have no concept of God or a very different perception of Deity. Two Book of Mormon missionaries, Ammon and Aaron, taught people who did not have a Christian background. They taught simple truths and invited their investigators to pray. Lamoni and his father were converted. Read Alma 18:24–40 and 22:4–23, and answer the questions below: - What did these missionaries teach about the nature of God? - How can you follow their examples? #### Scripture Study (Page 46) **What is the nature of God the Father and Jesus Christ?** Study the following scriptures to find answers to the question. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 Nephl 17:36 | 3 Nephl 27:13-22 | John 3:16-17 | | 2 Nephi 9:6 | D&C 38:1-3 | Acts 17:27-29 | | Mosiah 4:9 | D&C 130:22 | Romans 8:16 | | 3 Nephi 12:48 | Moses 1:39 | Hebrews 12:9 | | 3 Nephi 14:9-11 | Matthew 5:48 | 1 John 4:7-9 | > Lesson Two: Second Principle ##']","God is our Heavenly Father, and we are His children. He loves us, weeps with us when we suffer, and rejoices when we do what is right. We can show our love for Him through our choices and our obedience to His commandments. Heavenly Father has provided us with a way to be successful in this life and to return to live in His presence, but we must be pure and clean through obedience to do so."
How does Heavenly Father reveal His gospel in every dispensation?,"['The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 46) The restored gospel blesses and helps husbands and wives, parents and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and spiritual strength in their families. These blessings are available now and in eternity. The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current concerns and challenges. Because families are ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in eternity. God has established families to bring happiness to His children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere, and prepare them for eternal life. The home is the best place to teach, learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing family members with peace, joy, and happiness. Through prophets in every age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for individuals and families. > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation (Page 46) One important way that God shows His love for us is by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the power and authority given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation. They in turn teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer. The teachings of prophets are found in sacred books called scriptures. Our Father’s plan for us to be successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus’ Atonement at the center of that plan. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can receive eternal life if we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. “This is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:21). All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to accept or reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles. Those who choose to obey are blessed, but those who ignore, reject, or distort the gospel do not receive God’s promised blessings. Whenever people choose to disregard, disobey, or distort any gospel principle or ordinance, whenever they reject the Lord’s prophets, or whenever they fail to endure in faith, they distance themselves from God and begin to live in spiritual darkness. Eventually this leads to a condition called apostasy. When widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority to teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel. Biblical history has recorded many instances of God speaking to prophets, and it also tells of many instances of apostasy. To end each period of general apostasy, God has shown His love for His children by calling another prophet and giving him priesthood authority to restore and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ anew. In essence, the prophet acts as a steward to oversee the household of God here on earth. Such periods of time headed by prophetic responsibility are called dispensations. God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to Adam and gave him priesthood authority. Adam was the first prophet on the earth. By revelation, Adam learned of mankind’s proper relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Adam and Eve taught their children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel in all aspects of their lives. Adam was followed by other prophets, but over time the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel and fell into apostasy, choosing to be unrighteous. Thus began the pattern of prophetic dispensations that makes up much of the recorded history of the Old Testament. Heavenly Father revealed His gospel through direct communication to prophets such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Each prophet was called by God to begin a new dispensation of the gospel. To each of these prophets God granted priesthood authority and revealed eternal truths. Unfortunately, in each dispensation people eventually used their agency to choose to reject the gospel and then fell into apostasy. ### Prophets (Page 48) Determine what the person you are teaching understands about prophets. In most cultures there are people who believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God as defined in the restored gospel. Explain clearly that God establishes His kingdom on the earth by calling a prophet to establish a new dispensation. He gives that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. You might wonder how gospel dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people understand that God loves His children and that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.']","Heavenly Father reveals His gospel in every dispensation by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the power and authority to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation and teach it to others, testifying of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer. This process establishes a new dispensation, where the prophet helps people understand their relationship to Deity and how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ."

But when the Savior began His mortal ministry He established His Church again on the earth. Heavenly Father sent His Son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son . . . that the world through him might be saved” (John 3:16–17). Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take upon Him, by His suffering, the sins of all who would live on this earth and to overcome physical death. The Savior made an infinite atoning sacrifice so that if we have faith in Him, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end, we can receive forgiveness of our sins and enter and follow the path that will lead us to eternal life in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 31:13–21). During His earthly ministry, the Savior taught His gospel and performed many miracles. He called twelve men to be His Apostles and laid His hands on their heads to give them priest- hood authority. He organized His Church, fulfilled prophecy, and was rejected and crucified. Most important, He completed the Atonement. The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, completed all that His Heavenly Father sent Him to do. Before the Savior’s death and Resurrection, He gave His Apostles authority to teach His gospel, perform the ordinances of salvation, and establish His Church in the world. ### Scripture Study (Page 49) Articles of Faith 1:5, Matthew 10:1–10, Luke 6:13, John 15:16, and Hebrews 5:4. > Lesson one: Fifth Principle ## The Great Apostasy (Page 49) After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept the doctrines of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the doctrines were corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost. Without revelation and priesthood authority, people relied on human wisdom to interpret the scriptures and the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. False ideas were taught as truth. Much of the knowledge of the true character and nature of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was lost. The doctrines of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or forgotten. The priesthood authority given to Christ’s Apostles was no longer present on the earth. This apostasy eventually led to the emergence of many churches. After centuries of spiritual darkness, truth-seeking men and women protested against current religious practices. They recognized that many of the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel had been changed or lost. They sought for greater spiritual light, and many spoke of the need for a restoration of truth. They did not claim, however, that God had called them to be a prophet. Instead, they tried to reform teachings and practices that they believed had been changed or corrupted. Their efforts led to the organization of many Protestant churches. This Reformation resulted in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the final Restoration. The Savior’s Apostles foretold this universal apostasy. They also foretold that the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church would be restored once more upon the earth. #### Scripture Study (Page 49) Study these scriptures to learn more anout the great apostacy: - 1 Nephi 13, 2 Nephi 26:20–21, 2 Nephi 28, 4 Nephi 1:27, D&C 86:1–3, Matthew 24:9–11, Mark 12:1–9, Acts 3:19–21 - Acts 20:28–30, Galatians 1:6–9, 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 (JST verses 2, 3, 7–9), 1 Timothy 4:1–3, 2 Timothy 4:3–4, 2 Peter 2:1–2, Amos 8:11–12 - Topical Guide: “Apostasy of the Early Christian Church”, True to the Faith, “Apostasy,” pages 13–14 Our Search for Happiness, pages 23–32 Jesus the Christ, chapter 40, “The Long Night of Apostasy” ####']","Jesus Christ is the Son of God, sent by Heavenly Father to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death.

What role does 1 Nephi play in understanding the Great Apostasy?,"['The Great Apostasy (Page 50) Investigators must understand that a universal apostasy occurred following the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. If there had been no apostasy, there would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As guided by the Spirit, teach investigators about the Great Apostasy at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. **Key Points** - The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see Ephesians 2:19–20; 4:11–14). These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer upon others the priesthood authority. - People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see Matthew 24:9; 1 Nephi 11:32–34; 2 Nephi 27:5). With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation ceased, and doctrine became corrupted. - Even before the death of the Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. The simple doctrines and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see Isaiah 24:5). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrines from them (1 Nephi 13:26–40). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see 3 John 1:9–10). People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see 2 Timothy 4:3–4). - Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshiped according to the light they possessed and have received answers to their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). - Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy.']","1 Nephi 11:32–34 is referenced to illustrate how people rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles, leading to the absence of presiding priesthood authority in the Church, which is a key aspect of the Great Apostasy."

How did the religious freedom in the United States contribute to Joseph Smith's role in the Restoration of the Gospel?,"['The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith (Page 50) When the circumstances were right, Heavenly Father once again reached out to His children in love. He called a young man named Joseph Smith as a prophet. Through him the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth. Joseph Smith lived in the United States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at the time. It was at a time of great religious excitement in the eastern United States. His family members were deeply religious and constantly sought for truth. But many ministers claimed to have the true gospel. Joseph desired “to know which of all the sects was right,” (Joseph Smith—History 1:18). The Bible taught there was “one Lord, one faith, one baptism” (Ephesians 4:5). Joseph attended different churches, but he remained confused about which church he should join. He later wrote: *“So great were the confusions and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was . . . to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. . . . In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10).* As Joseph sought truth among the different faiths, he turned to the Bible for guidance. He read, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (James 1:5). Because of this passage, Joseph decided to ask God what he should do. In the spring of 1820 he went to a nearby grove of trees and knelt in prayer. He described his experience: *“I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. . . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17).* In this vision God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith. The Savior told Joseph not to join any of the churches, for they “were all wrong” and “all their creeds were an abomination.” He stated, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof” (Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Even though many good people believed in Christ and tried to understand and teach His gospel, they did not have the fulness of truth or the priesthood authority to baptize and perform other saving ordinances. They had inherited a state of apostasy as each generation was influenced by what the previous one passed on, including changes in the doctrines and in ordinances such as baptism. As God had done with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to the earth. After the appearance of the Father and the Son, other heavenly messengers, or angels were sent to Joseph Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery. John the Baptist appeared and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, which includes the authority to perform the ordinance of baptism. Peter, James, and John (three of Christ’s original Apostles) appeared and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, restoring the same authority given to Christ’s Apostles anciently. With this priesthood authority, Joseph Smith was directed to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth. Through him, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles. The time in which we live is referred to by Bible prophets as the last days, the latter days, or the dispensation of the fulness of times. It is the period of time just before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It is the final dispensation. This is why the Church is named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A living prophet directs the Church today. This prophet, the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is the authorized successor to Joseph Smith. He and the present Apostles trace their authority to Jesus Christ in an unbroken chain of ordinations through Joseph Smith. ###']","Joseph Smith lived in the United States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at the time. This environment of religious freedom allowed Joseph Smith to explore different faiths and ultimately seek divine guidance, leading to his role in the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The religious excitement and diversity in the eastern United States provided a backdrop for his spiritual quest, culminating in his vision where God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him, instructing him not to join any existing churches and eventually restoring the fulness of the gospel through him."
Who Father Joseph Smith see?,"['Memorize Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17 (Page 52) Memorize Joseph Smith’s description of seeing the Father and the Son (Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17), and always be ready to describe the First Vision using his own words. Do not rush through it. Bear sincere testimony that you know it is true. Do not hesitate to explain how you came to know of its truth. Invite your companion to do so as well. ### Bear Testimony (Page 52) An important part of a missionary’s duty is to bear testimony of the current prophet and president of the Church. #### Scripture Study (page 52) Study 2 Nephi 3, D&C 112:30, Ephesians 1:10, Ephesians 4:5, James 1:5, and Brochure, The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith > Lesson One: Seventh Principle ## The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Page 52) Knowing that doubt, disbelief, and misinformation would remain after centuries of darkness, our loving Heavenly Father brought forth an ancient volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible, which contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. This volume of holy scripture provides convincing evidence that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God. This record is the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where gold plates had lain hidden for centuries. These gold plates contained the writings of prophets giving an account of God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Joseph Smith translated the contents of these plates by the power of God. The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of the Savior and taught His gospel. After His Resurrection, Christ appeared to these people. He taught them His gospel and established His Church. The Book of Mormon proves that “God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old” (D&C 20:11). In order to know that the Book of Mormon is true, a person must read, ponder, and pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth. ### Use the Book of Mormon to confirm the Truth of the Restoration (page 53) Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon: “God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?” Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite the investigator to commit to reading portions of the Book of Mormon and apply the principles described in these two paragraphs. When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her. #### Scripture study (page 53) Study the Title page of the Book of Mormon, Introduction to the Book of Mormon - paragraphs 1-7, D&C 1:17-23, D&C 20:5-12, and Joseph Smith—History 1:27-64']",Joseph Smith described seeing the Father and the Son in Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17.
What John 14:26 say about Holy Ghost?,"['> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##']","John 14:26 is referenced in the context of scripture study, indicating its relevance to understanding the role of the Holy Ghost in teaching truth through feelings and thoughts."

God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet.

Who Joseph Smith be and what he do?,"['Key Definitions (page 58) - **Agency:** The ability and privilege God gives people to choose and to act for themselves. - **Apostasy:** A turning away from the truth by individuals, the Church, or entire nations. It includes rebellion against authority and rejection of prophets. Evidence of apostasy includes transgressing God’s laws, changing gospel ordinances, and breaking covenants (see Isaiah 24:5). - **Dispensation:** A period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood. In addition to Jesus Christ, prophets such as Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Joseph Smith have each started a new gospel dispensation. When the Lord organizes a dispensation, the gospel is revealed anew so that the people of that dispensation do not have to depend on past dispensations for knowledge of the plan of salvation. The dispensation begun by Joseph Smith is known as the “dispensation of the fulness of times.” - **Priesthood:** The authority and power that God gives to man to act in the name of Jesus Christ in all things for the salvation of mankind. - **Prophet:** A man who has been called by and speaks for God. As a messenger of God, a prophet receives priesthood authority, commandments, prophecies, and revelations from God. His responsibility is to make known God’s will and true character to mankind and to show the meaning of His dealings with them. A prophet denounces sin and foretells its consequences. He is a preacher of righteousness. On occasion, a prophet may be inspired to foretell the future for the benefit of mankind. His primary responsibility, however, is to bear witness of Christ. - **Redeemer:** Jesus Christ is the great Redeemer of mankind because He, through His Atonement, paid the price for the sins of mankind and made possible the resurrection of all people. To redeem is to deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment. Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin. Jesus’ Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death. Through His Atonement, which includes His suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross as well as His Resurrection, those who have faith in Him and who repent are redeemed from spiritual death. - **Reformer:** To reform is to make changes to something in order to improve it. The term reformers refers to those men and women (such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, William Tyndale, and John Wycliffe) who protested the practices of the existing church, which they felt needed to be reformed. - **Restoration:** To restore means to return to a former condition, or to bring back. The Restoration, as used by Latter-day Saints, means that the true Church of Jesus Christ, which was lost through apostasy, was brought back as it originally existed when organized by Jesus Christ. Unlike the Reformation, the Restoration was accomplished by divine authority through revelation. - **Revelation:** Communication from God to His children on earth. Revelation may come through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost by way of inspiration, visions, dreams, or visits by angels. Revelation provides guidance that can lead the faithful to eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom. The Lord reveals His work to His prophets and confirms to believers that the revelations to the prophets are true (see Amos 3:7). Through revelation, the Lord provides individual guidance for every person who seeks it and who has faith, repents, and is obedient to the gospel of Jesus Christ. **']",Joseph Smith started a new gospel dispensation known as the 'dispensation of the fulness of times.'

Cud yu pleese explane the meanin of D&C 93:29 in the context of our pre-earth life and God's plan for us?,"['Pre-Earth Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us (Page 62) Many people wonder, “Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going?” The plan of salvation gives us the answers to these questions. God is the Father of our spirits. We are literally His children, and He loves us. We lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before we were born on this earth. We were not, however, like our Heavenly Father, nor could we ever become like Him and enjoy all the blessings that He enjoys without the experience of living in mortality with a physical body. God’s whole purpose—His work and His glory—is to enable each of us to enjoy all His blessings. He has provided a perfect plan to accomplish His purpose. We understood and accepted this plan before we came to the earth. In the scriptures God’s plan is called a merciful plan, the plan of happiness, the plan of redemption, and the plan of salvation. Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan. Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ fulfilled His Father’s purpose and made it possible for each of us to enjoy immortality and eternal life. Satan, or the devil, is an enemy to God’s plan. Agency, or the ability to choose, is one of God’s greatest gifts to His children. Our eternal progression depends on how we use this gift. We must choose whether to follow Jesus Christ or follow Satan. We are physically separated from God during life on earth, but He wants every one of His children to find peace in this life and a fulness of joy in His presence after this life. He wants us to become like Him. #### Scripture Study (Page 63) - **Children of God** - D&C 93:29, Acts 17:29, Hebrews 12:9 - **Purpose** - Moses 1:39, and John 17:3 - **Premortal Life** - D&C 138:53–56, Moses 3:5, Abraham 3:22–26, Jeremiah 1:5, and Topical Guide, “Man, Antemortal Existence of”']","D&C 93:29 is referenced in the context of understanding our identity as children of God. It is part of the scripture study that highlights our premortal existence and our relationship with God. The context explains that we lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before being born on earth, and God's purpose is to enable us to enjoy all His blessings. This scripture, along with others, helps us understand our divine heritage and the plan of salvation, which includes our journey from pre-earth life to mortality and beyond."
Wht does 2 Nephi teach about the Fall of Adam and Eve?,"['> Lesson Two: Second Principle ## The Creation (Page 63) Under the direction of the Father, Jesus Christ created the earth as a place for us to live and gain experience. In order to progress and become like God, each of us had to obtain a body and be tested during a time of probation on the earth. While on the earth we are out of God’s physical presence. We do not remember our pre-earth life. We must walk by faith rather than by sight. #### Scripture Study (Page 63) - 1 Nephi 17:36, Alma 30:44, D&C 88:41–47 - Moses 2:1, Moses 6:63, Abraham 3:24–25 - JST, John 1:1–3 2, Corinthians 5:6–7 > Lesson Two: Third Principle ## Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve (Page 63) Adam and Eve were the first of God’s children to come to the earth. God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were created in God’s image, with bodies of flesh and bones. While Adam and Eve were in the garden, they were still in God’s presence and could have lived forever. They lived in innocence, and God provided for their needs. In the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam and Eve their agency. He commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Obeying this commandment meant that they could remain in the garden, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality. They could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain. Satan tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and they chose to do so. This was part of God’s plan. Because of this choice, they were cast from the garden and out of God’s physical presence. This event is called the Fall. Separation from God’s presence is spiritual death. Adam and Eve became mortal—subject to physical death, or separation of the body and spirit. They could now experience disease and all types of suffering. They had moral agency or the ability to choose between good and evil. This made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin. In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God’s spirit children could come to earth, obtain physical bodies, and be tested. Only in this way could God’s children progress and become like Him. ### Teaching about the Fall (Page 64) When first teaching this doctrine, do not teach everything you know about it. Explain very simply that God chose two of His children, Adam and Eve, to become the first parents on earth. After their transgression they were subject to both sin and death. By themselves they could not return to live with Heavenly Father. The Lord spoke to Adam and taught him the plan of salvation and redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ. By following that plan, Adam and his family could have joy in this life and return to live with God (see Alma 18:36; 22:12–14). #### Scripture Study (Page 64) - In the Garden: 2 Nephi 2, Moses 2:26–31, Moses 3:15–17, Moses 5:11, Genesis 1:26–31, Genesis 2:15–17 - The Fall: 2 Nephi 2:25, Alma 12:22–34, Moses 4, Moses 5:10–12, Genesis 3 > Lesson Two: Fourth Principle ##']","2 Nephi 2 discusses the Fall of Adam and Eve, explaining that their choice to eat the forbidden fruit was part of God's plan. This event allowed them to experience opposition, learn, and progress, making it possible for them to have children and for God's spirit children to come to earth, obtain physical bodies, and be tested."
Wht role does Jesus Crist play in our return to God?,"['Our Life on Earth (Page 64) Life on earth is an opportunity and a blessing. Our purpose in this life is to have joy and prepare to return to God’s presence. In mortality we live in a condition where we are subject to both physical and spiritual death. God has a perfect, glorified, immortal body of flesh and bones. To become like God and return to His presence, we too must have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones. However, because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, every person on earth has an imperfect, mortal body and will eventually die. If not for the Savior Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father. Along with physical death, sin is a major obstacle that keeps us from becoming like our Father in Heaven and returning to His presence. In our mortal condition we often yield to temptation, break God’s commandments, and sin. During our life on earth each of us makes mistakes. Although it sometimes appears otherwise, sin always leads to unhappiness. Sin causes feelings of guilt and shame. Because of our sins, we are unable to return to live with Heavenly Father unless we are first forgiven and cleansed. While we are in mortality, we have experiences that bring us happiness. We also have experiences that bring us pain and sorrow, some of which is caused by the sinful acts of others. These experiences provide us opportunities to learn and to grow, to distinguish good from evil, and to make choices. God influences us to do good; Satan tempts us to commit sin. As with physical death, we cannot overcome the effects of sin by ourselves. We are helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ. #### Scripture Study (Page 65) - Probation or Testing Period: 2 Nephi 2:21, 2 Nephi 9:27, Mosiah 3:19, Alma 12:21–24, Alma 34:31–35, Alma 42:2–10, Abraham 3:25–26 - Choice: 2 Nephi 2:26–29, Joshua 24:15, For the Strength of Youth, “Agency and Accountability” - Good and Evil: Moroni 7:12–19 - Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:8–10, 1 John 3:4 - The Unclean Cannot Be with God: 1 Nephi 10:20–21, Alma 41:10–11, 3 Nephi 27:19, Moses 6:57']","If not for the Savior Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father. We are helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ, which allows us to overcome the effects of sin and return to live with Heavenly Father."
How does the gift of the Holy Ghost contribute to the process of returning to live with God according to the plan of salvation?,"['The Atonement (page 65) Before the world was organized, our Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ made it possible for us to overcome the effects of the Fall. All of the prophets since the world began have testified of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer. We will all suffer physical death, but Jesus Christ overcame the obstacle of physical death for us. When He died on the cross, His spirit became separated from His body. On the third day, His spirit and His body were reunited eternally, never to be separated again. He appeared to many people, showing them that He had an immortal body of flesh and bone. The reuniting of body and spirit is called resurrection and is a gift promised to each of us. Because of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, we will all be resurrected regardless of whether we have done good or evil in this life. We will have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones that will never again be subject to disease, pain, or death. The resurrection makes it possible to return to God’s presence to be judged but does not guarantee that we will be able to live in His presence. To receive that blessing, we must also be cleansed from sin. God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to overcome the obstacle of sin in addition to the obstacle of physical death. We are not responsible for the Fall of Adam and Eve, but we are responsible for our own sins. God cannot look on sin with any degree of allowance, and sin prevents us from living in His presence. Only through the Savior’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin so that we can live with God again. This is possible through exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. To fulfill the plan of salvation, Christ paid the penalty for our sins. He alone was able to do that. He was called and prepared in pre-earth life. He was the literal Son of God in the flesh. He was sinless and completely obedient to His Father. Though tempted, He never gave in to temptation. When the Father asked His Beloved Son to pay the price of the world’s sins, Jesus was prepared and willing. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and His suffering and death on the cross, and it ended with His Resurrection. Though He suffered beyond comprehension—so much so that He bled from every pore and asked whether it were possible that this burden be lifted from Him—He submitted to the Father’s will in a supreme expression of love for His Father and for us. This triumph of Jesus Christ over spiritual death by His suffering and over physical death by His Resurrection is called the Atonement. Christ promises to forgive our sins on the condition that we accept Him by exercising faith in Him, repenting, receiving baptism by immersion, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and striving faithfully to keep His commandments to the end of our lives. Through continuing repentance, we may obtain forgiveness and be cleansed of our sins by the power of the Holy Ghost. We are relieved of the burden of guilt and shame, and through Jesus Christ we become worthy to return to the presence of God. As we rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In paying the penalty for our sins, Jesus did not, however, eliminate our personal responsibility. We must show that we accept Him and that we will follow His command- ments. Only through the gift of the Atonement can we return to live with God. ####']","The gift of the Holy Ghost is part of the process of returning to live with God as it helps cleanse us from sin.

What is the role of the JST in understanding the doctrine of resurrection?,"['Scripture Study (Page 66) - Resurrection: 2 Nephi 9:6–7, Alma 11:42–45, Alma 40:23, Helaman 14:15–19, D&C 88:27–32 Luke 24:1–10, 36–39, 1 Corinthians 15:20–23, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40, Topical Guide, “Resurrection”, Bible Dictionary - “Death,” “Resurrection” - Atonement: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, Alma 7:11–13, Alma 34:8–10, D&C 19:15–19, D&C 45:3–5, John 3:16–17, 1 John 1:7, Bible Dictionary, “Atonement” - The Gospel—The Way: 2 Nephi 9:1–24, 2 Nephi 31, Alma 11:40, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27, Moroni 7:27–28 > Lesson Two: Sixth Principle ## The Spirit World (page 66) Even though Christ conquered physical death, all people must die, for death is part of the process by which we are transformed from mortality to immortality. At death our spirits go to the spirit world. Death does not change our personality or our desires for good or evil. Those who chose to obey God in this life live in a state of happiness, peace, and rest from troubles and care. Those who chose not to obey in this life and did not repent live in a state of unhappiness. In the spirit world the gospel is preached to those who did not obey the gospel or have the opportunity to hear it while on earth. We remain in the spirit world until we are resurrected. #### Scripture Study (Page 67) - Gospel Preached to the Dead: D&C 138, 1 Peter 3:19–20, 1 Peter 4:6 - Death and the Spirit World: Alma 34:34, Alma 40:11–14, Ecclesiastes 12:7 > Lesson Two: Seventh Principle ## The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality (Page 67) When our bodies and spirits are reunited through the resurrection, we will be brought into God’s presence to be judged. We will remember perfectly our righteousness and our guilt. If we have repented, we will receive mercy. We will be rewarded according to our works and our desires. Through the resurrection all people will become immortal—they will live forever. Immortality is a free gift to all people, whether they are righteous or wicked. Eternal life is not, however, the same as immortality. Eternal life is a gift of God given only to those who obey His gospel. It is the highest state that we can achieve. It comes to those who are freed from sin and suffering through the Atonement of Christ. It is exaltation, which means living with God forever in eternal families. It is to know God and Jesus Christ and to experience the life they enjoy. ### Resurrection and Reincarnation (Page 67) Some people may confuse the doctrine of resurrection with the concept of reincarnation. The concept of reincarnation involves being born into the world again in a different form and is false doctrine. The doctrine of resurrection involves receiving an eternal reward of an immortal body of flesh and bone. This is true doctrine. Make sure those you teach understand clearly the doctrine of the resurrection. > Lesson Two: Eighth Principle ## Kingdoms of Glory (Page 67) During our mortal lives we make choices regarding good and evil. God rewards us according to our works and desires. Because God rewards everyone according to deeds done in the body, there are different kingdoms of glory to which we may be assigned after the Judgment. Those who have repented of their sins and received the ordinances of the gospel and kept the associated covenants will be cleansed by the Atonement of Christ. They will receive exaltation in the highest kingdom, also known as the celestial kingdom. They will live in God’s presence, become like Him, and receive a fulness of joy. They will live together for eternity with those of their family who qualify. In the scriptures this kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun. People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars.']","The JST, or Joseph Smith Translation, is referenced in the context of scripture study on the topic of resurrection, indicating its importance in providing clarity and understanding of the doctrine. It is listed alongside other scriptural references that discuss the resurrection, suggesting its role in enhancing comprehension of this doctrine."

It maps our eternal journey through premortality, mortal life, death, resurrection, and to our life in the eternities. The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him. The plan focuses on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ in overcoming the effects of the Fall and making eternal life possible for us.

What Book of Mormon say about life?,"['Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 69) Our message helps us understand the purpose of life and who we are. It gives us hope and helps us find peace, joy, and happiness. It tells us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. God is our Father, and He loves us. We are His children. We are part of His family, and we lived with Him before we were born on this earth. He has a plan of happiness that makes it possible for us to return to His presence after this life. Our progress depends on how we use our God-given agency, or ability to choose. As part of that plan, the Fall of Adam made it possible for us to come to earth, gain a physical body, have experience, and have families of our own. But the Fall also brought physical death, which is separation of the spirit from the body, and spiritual death, which is separation from God. Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan. Christ’s atoning sacrifice overcame the effects of both physical and spiritual death. We will all be resurrected and will live forever with physical bodies free of pain and sickness. Christ also made it possible to overcome spiritual death. As we live His gospel He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. As part of God’s merciful plan, we will all suffer a physical death. Our spirits will be separated from our bodies and will live for a time in the spirit world. We will then be resurrected with an immortal body, an eternal union of our body and spirit. We will be judged according to our works and desires. Those who have lived the gospel will receive our Father in Heaven’s greatest gift, the gift of eternal life in His presence. Our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love to reveal His plan of happiness.

If we obey, we are blessed. If we disobey, we sin and receive the consequences. – All sin must be paid for, either by ourselves or by Christ (see D&C 19:15–20). – We make choices, and we all commit sin (see Romans 3:23). – We have experiences that bring us happiness and also sorrow. – We cannot overcome either physical or spiritual death without Christ. - The Atonement – Because Jesus Christ overcame physical death, we will all be resurrected (see Alma 11:41–43). – Through Christ’s Atonement we can become clean from sin so that we can return to live in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 9:8–9). – Christ will forgive our sins as we have faith in Him, repent, receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. - The Spirit World – All people must die. – At death our spirits go to the spirit world. – We live in either a state of misery or a state of peace and rest, depending on how we lived in this life. - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality – Our spirits and bodies will be reunited in the resurrection (see Alma 11:42–45; 40:23). – We will return to God’s presence to be judged according to our works and desires. – If we have repented, we will receive mercy. – Eternal life is a gift of God given to those who fully obey the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&C 14:7). - Kingdoms of Glory (see D&C 76; 137; 1 Corinthians 15:40–42). – We receive rewards according to our works and desires (see D&C 137:9).']","The Book of Mormon teaches about God's plan of happiness, which helps us understand the purpose of life, who we are, and where we will go after this life.

What Adam do?,"['Key Definitions (Page 72) Following are terms that are frequently not understood. Make sure you explain them clearly and find out if those you are teaching understand. - **Atonement:** As used in the scriptures, to atone is to suffer the penalty for an act of sin, thereby removing the effects of sin from the repentant sinners and allowing them to be reconciled to God. Jesus Christ suffered in Gethsemane and on the cross. He was the only one capable of making a perfect Atonement for all mankind. He suffered the penalty for our sins in Gethsemane and died on the cross. He took upon Himself the pains, sicknesses, temptations, afflictions, and infirmities of us all (see Alma 7:11–12). - **Exaltation:** Eternal life in God’s presence; to become like our Father in Heaven and live in His presence. The greatest of all the gifts of God. Exaltation comes through the Atonement of Christ and through obedience to all the laws and ordinances of the gospel. - **Fall (of Adam and Eve):** When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, they became mortal—that is, subject to sin and death. Adam became the “first flesh” upon the earth (Moses 3:7). Latter-day revelation makes clear that the Fall is a blessing and that Adam and Eve should be honored as the first parents of all mankind. - **Judgment:** God, through Jesus Christ, will judge us individually to determine the eternal glory we will receive. This judgment will be based on our obedience to God’s commandments, including our acceptance of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. We will receive our eternal reward based on whether our works and desires have been good or evil. - **Immortality:** The condition of living forever in a resurrected state, not subject to physical death. - **Mortality:** The time from birth until physical death. - **Physical death:** Separation of our spirit, which lives forever and cannot die, from our physical body. - **Premortal life (premortality; pre-earth life):** As spirit children of our Father in Heaven, we lived in His presence before we were born on this earth. In premortal life we did not have physical bodies. - **Redemption:** To deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment. Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin. Jesus’ Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death. Through His Atonement, those who have faith in Him and repent are also redeemed from spiritual death. - **Resurrection:** The reuniting of the spirit body with the physical body of flesh and bones after death. After resurrection, the spirit and body will never again be separated, and the person is immortal. Every person born on earth will be resurrected because Jesus Christ overcame death. - **Salvation:** To be saved from physical and spiritual death. All people will be saved from physical death by the grace of God, through the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Each individual can also be saved from spiritual death as well as by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ. This faith is manifested in a life of obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel and service to Christ. - **Spiritual death:** Separation from God and His influences; to die as to things pertaining to righteousness. Spiritual death was introduced into the world by the fall of Adam (see Alma 42:6–7). Mortals with evil thoughts, words, and works are spiritually dead while still alive on earth (see 2 Nephi 9:39). Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and by obedience to the principles and ordinances of the gospel, men and women can become clean from sin and overcome spiritual death. ###']","When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, they became mortal—that is, subject to sin and death.

How does the Resurrection of Jesus Christ relate to the judgment of individuals according to their works and desires?,"['> Lesson Three: First Principle ## Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin (Page 74) God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, into the world so that all of God’s children would have the possibility of returning to live in His presence after they die. Only through the Savior’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin so that we can live in our Heavenly Father’s presence. Becoming clean from sin is being healed spiritually (see 3 Nephi 9:13; 18:32). Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; D&C 137:9). We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy. Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57). The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence. However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through the Atonement and living the gospel we become worthy to enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We must show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by keeping His commandments and obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. #### Sin (Page 75) The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions. Discourage or ask investigators not to discuss their transgressions. #### Scripture Study (Page 75) - God Sent His Son: Alma 11:40, John 3:16–17 - Salvation through Christ: 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 2 Nephi 9:21–24, Alma 34:8–9, 14–16 - Christ Is Our Advocate: D&C 45:3–5 - Mercy and Justice: Mosiah 15:9, Alma 42:22–25 > Lesson Three: Second Principle ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 75) The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting repentance. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior. We want to learn what His commandments are and then obey them. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoid sin. We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. We can also develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing, by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing the word of God (see Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God (see Helaman 15:7–8). As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually. #### Scripture Study (Page 76) - Faith, Power, and Salvation: 1 Nephi 7:12, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 25:23, Moroni 7:33–34, Moroni 10:7 - The Doctrine of Faith: Alma 32, Ephesians 2:8, Bible Dictionary, “Faith” - Examples of Faith: Ether 12, Hebrews 11 - Works and Obedience: 1 Nephi 3:7, James 2:17–26, D&C 130:20–21 - Faith unto Repentance: Alma 34 > Lesson Three: Third Principle ##']","Because of Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires."
How does the Church play a role in the process of repentance according to the context provided?,"['Repentance (Page 76) The second principle of the gospel is repentance. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy only on condition of repentance. To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who can help us repent. We ask God in prayer to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away from our sins and do them no more. We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper. Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son. Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions. In addition, we should continually improve—to develop Christlike qualities, to grow in knowledge, and to serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior expects of us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily. #### Scripture Study (Page 77) - We All Sin: Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:7–8 - Repentance: Alma 34:8–17, D&C 58:42–43, D&C 61:2, 2 Corinthians 7:9–10, Bible Dictionary, “Repentance” - Redemption and Forgiveness: Helaman 5:10–11 - Mercy Claims the Penitent: Alma 12:32–35, Alma 42:13, 21–24, D&C 18:10–13']","The Church plays a role in the process of repentance by having God's authorized Church leaders to whom individuals can confess very serious sins. These leaders can help individuals repent, which is a part of bringing one's life in line with God's will."
What does Mosiah 5:7–8 teach about the significance of baptism and becoming spiritual sons and daughters of Christ?,"['Baptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. ####']","Mosiah 5:7–8 teaches that through baptism, we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ. This signifies a rebirth and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ, symbolizing the end of our old life of sin."
How does the Book of Mormon guide missionaries in preparing investigators for baptism and the reception of the Holy Ghost?,"['Before Baptism (Page 78) “Ensure that [investigators] have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. Investigators should live the principles of moral worthiness, the Word of Wisdom, and commit to pay tithing. If missionaries feel additional preparation is needed, they should postpone baptism until the investigator meets the standard. *“Before baptism each investigator should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch president, and attend several sacrament meetings”* (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). #### Scripture Study (Page 79) - Christ’s Example: 2 Nephi 31:4–18, Matthew 3:13–17 - The Baptismal Covenant: Mosiah 5:8–10, Mosiah 18:8–10, D&C 20:37 - Qualifications for Baptism: 2 Nephi 9:23, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 7:14–15, 3 Nephi 11:23–27, Moroni 6:1–4, D&C 20:37, Acts 2:37–39 - The Lord Institutes the Sacrament: 3 Nephi 18:1–18, Luke 22:15–20 - Promised Blessings of Baptism: Mosiah 4:11–12, 26, Moroni 8:25–26, John 3:5, Romans 6:4 - The Sacrament Prayers: Moroni 4 and 5, D&C 20:75–79 - Partaking of the Sacrament: D&C 27:2, 1 Corinthians 11:23–29 - Necessity for Authority: D&C 22, Hebrews 5:4 > Lesson Three: Fifth Principle ## The Gift of the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ. After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life. The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through apostasy, was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only through membership in the Church can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This authority makes the Church different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&C 1:30). #### Guidance from the Holy Ghost (Page 79) Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin. To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed. #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Nature of the Holy Ghost: D&C 130:22–23, John 3:1–8, Galatians 5:22–23, Bible Dictionary, “Earnest” and “Holy Ghost” - Blessings and Influence from the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 32:1–5, 2 Nephi 33:1–2, Moses 6:61, John 14:26, Topical Guide, “Holy Ghost, Comforter” and “Holy Ghost, Gifts of” - Importance of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: 2 Nephi 31:11–12, 18, 21, 3 Nephi 18:36–37, 3 Nephi 19:13, 3 Nephi 27:19–20, D&C 19:31, D&C 33:15, Acts 19:1–6 > Lesson Three: Sixth Principle ##']","The Book of Mormon provides guidance for missionaries in preparing investigators for baptism by emphasizing the development of faith in Christ, repentance, and living principles of moral worthiness, as outlined in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. It highlights the importance of receiving all missionary lessons, meeting church leaders, and attending sacrament meetings before baptism. Additionally, the Book of Mormon underscores the necessity of baptism by water and the Spirit, teaching that only through receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost can one achieve a remission of sins and become spiritually reborn. This guidance is crucial for missionaries to ensure that investigators are fully prepared for the covenant of baptism and the companionship of the Holy Ghost."
How can families ensure they have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost according to Latter-day Saint teachings?,"['Endure to the End (Page 80) Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us.

If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost considered essential in the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ?,"['Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 81) Our message is one of faith and hope. We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

After baptism, the Holy Ghost is promised to us, and it plays a crucial role in our spiritual journey by teaching us, cleansing us, testifying of the truth, warning us, and directing us. It also helps us feel peace, love, and joy, and motivates us to serve others and strive to please the Lord. The Holy Ghost is integral to enduring to the end on the gospel path, which includes faith, repentance, making and keeping covenants, and receiving the Holy Ghost, ultimately qualifying us for eternal life."
How does the Holy Ghost guide missionaries in teaching the commandments effectively?,"['For example, the Restoration of the goepel is called a restitution (see Acts 3:19–21). The word restoration also refers to the restoration of the body (see Alma 41:10–15). ### Other Terms That May Need Further Definition for Those You Teach (Page 84) - Clean from sin - Prayer - Temptation - Confession - Sacrament - Forgiveness - Strait and narrow path > Lesson Four # The Commandments: Preparing for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 85) There are many ways to teach the commandments found in this lesson. For example, you might teach a few of the commandments from this lesson as part of the first three lessons, or you might teach several commandments as a single lesson. What you do should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. ## Prepare to Teach (Page 85) Your purpose in teaching the commandments is to help people live the gospel by exercising faith in Jesus Christ and repenting as they prepare for baptism and confirmation. By obeying the commandments, people will grow in their testimony of the gospel, show that they have “broken hearts and contrite spirits,” and begin to repent of all their sins (see Moroni 6:1–4; D&C 20:37). This lesson is organized differently from the first three. The first three lessons explain the doctrinal foundation for the gospel of Jesus Christ. This lesson explains specific commandments God has given that help us apply gospel principles in our lives. There are many ways to teach this lesson. The approach you take should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. Constantly think and pray about how to help investigators live the gospel. Ideas include: - Teaching one or more commandments as part of the first three lessons. When doing so, consider the principle taught in Alma 12:32: “God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption” (italics added). Certain commandments, such as prayer and scripture study, might be taught best as part of the first three lessons. Other commandments might be best taught after you have laid the doctrinal foundation of the gospel found in the first three lessons. - Teaching two or three of the commandments as a single lesson. - Teaching a single commandment as a lesson. - Teaching the commandments in the context of the gospel. Briefly review the lesson on the gospel of Jesus Christ before teaching one or more of the commandments. As you do so, you can help investigators see how the commandments fit into the larger picture of exercising faith in the Savior and repenting in preparation for baptism and confirmation. Their lives can be blessed as they see the gospel of Jesus Christ as a pattern for living. You may be able to teach some investigators in a few visits; others may require more visits. You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. There are many ways you may approach teaching this lesson. Which commandment you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it is best determined by the needs of the investigators and the direction of the Spirit. ##']","The Holy Ghost provides direction to missionaries in determining the needs of the investigators and how best to teach the commandments, ensuring that the lessons are tailored to help people live the gospel and prepare for baptism and confirmation."
Wht role does the Spirit play in our obedience to God?,"['Learn about the Commandments and Commitments (Page 86) As you study this lesson, follow the pattern below: - Study the section that describes the commandment and write a simple lesson plan with three to five main points. - Teach a two- or three-minute version to your companion. Practice how you will extend each commitment invitation and how you will resolve concerns. - Discuss ways to follow through on each commitment that investigators have accepted. ## Obedience (Page 86) God gives us commandments for our benefit. They are instructions from a loving Father in Heaven to help us have happy lives. He also gives us agency, or the ability and opportunity to choose between good and evil. When we obey God, we follow the influence of the Spirit and choose to conform to His will. Obedience to the commandments brings us peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. Obedience shows our love for God. Disobedience brings us sorrow. Heavenly Father knows our weaknesses and is patient with us. He blesses us as we strive to obey His commandments. He expects us to obey Him so He can bless us. #### Scripture Study (Page 86) - Agency: 2 Nephi 2:26-29, Alma 12:31, D&C 58:26-29, D&C 82:8-10, Topical Guide, “Agency” | - Obedience: D&C 130:20-21, John 14:15, 21, Ecclesiastes 12:13 **Commitment** - Will you obey the laws of God? ##']","When we obey God, we follow the influence of the Spirit and choose to conform to His will.

"Wht do 1 Kings 19:11-12 teech us abot listenin to the still, smal voice?","['Pray Often (Page 87) God commands us to pray to Him. You can pray at any time and in any setting. The Lord has taught us to kneel and pray in the morning and in the evening, as individuals and with our families. Our Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. Through daily prayer we receive divine guidance and blessings. We should always pray sincerely. We should also pray with “real intent,” which means we are committed to act on the answer that we receive. We pray with faith to our Father in Heaven in the name of Jesus Christ (see Moses 5:8). Because He is our Father and we are His children, He will answer our prayers. We begin our prayers by addressing our Father in Heaven. We end our prayers by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.” In prayer we speak openly and honestly with our loving Father in Heaven. We express gratitude and thanksgiving for our blessings. We may acknowledge our love for Him. We also ask for help, protection, and direction according to our needs. As we pray with faith, sincerity, and real intent, we will see God’s influence in our lives. He will guide us in our daily lives and help us make good decisions. He will bless us with feelings of comfort and peace. He will warn us of danger and strengthen us to resist temptation. He will forgive our sins. We will feel closer to Him. We must learn to recognize His influence in our lives. We must learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Spirit. We can recognize when the Holy Ghost is teaching us the truth. Our minds will be filled with inspiring and uplifting thoughts. We will be enlightened, or given new knowledge. Our hearts will have feelings of peace, joy, and love. We will want to do good and be helpful to others. These feelings are hard to describe but can be recognized as we experience them. #### Scripture Study (Page 87) | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 2 Nephi 32:8-9 | D&C 6:22-23 | D&C 19:28 | | Enos 1:1-12 | D&C 8:2-3 | 1 Kings 19:11-12 | | Alma 34:17-28 | D&C 9:7-9 | Bible Dictionary, “Prayer” | | Moroni 10:3-5 | | | **Commitment** - Will you kneel and pray daily as individuals and as a family? ## Study the Scriptures (Page 87) The scriptures are written records of God’s dealings with His children as recorded by prophets under the influence of the Holy Ghost. We show our faith by studying, believing, and obeying God’s revealed word. We diligently search the scriptures to understand the truth. We feast upon them because they open the door to revelation and show us what we need to do and become. We search the scriptures to learn about Jesus Christ and His gospel. Faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from God and comes through studying and living His word and His gospel. The approved scriptures of the Church, also called the standard works, are the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.

How come 3 Nephi 18:1–25 be important for keepin' the Sabbath day holy?,"['## Keep the Sabbath Day Holy (Page 88) Our Sabbath-day behavior is a reflection of our commitment to honor and worship God. By keeping the Sabbath day holy, we show God our willingness to keep our covenants. Each Sabbath day we go to the Lord’s house to worship Him. While there we partake of the sacrament to remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement. We renew our covenants and show that we are willing to repent of our sins and mistakes. On this day, we enjoy a rest from our labors. As we attend Church services and worship together, we strengthen each other. We are renewed by our association with friends and family. Our faith is strengthened as we study the scriptures and learn more about the restored gospel. When a community or nation grows careless in its Sabbath activities, its religious life decays and all aspects of life are negatively affected. The blessings associated with keeping the Sabbath day holy are lost. We should refrain from shopping on the Sabbath and participating in other commercial and sporting activities that now commonly desecrate the Sabbath. Latter-day Saints should set this holy day apart from activities of the world by entering into a spirit of worship, thanksgiving, service, and family-centered activities appropriate to the Sabbath. As Church members endeavor to make their Sabbath activities compatible with the intent and Spirit of the Lord, their lives will be filled with joy and peace. #### Scripture Study (Page 88) - 3 Nephi 18:1–25, D&C 59:9–15, Exodus 20:8–11, Exodus 31:12–17, Isaiah 58:13–14 #### Sit with Investigators or Members at Church (Page 88) When attending sacrament meetings or stake conferences, missionary companionships should sit with investigators, recent converts, or members.

Are you willing to obey this law [before your baptism]? ## Baptism and Confirmation (Page 89) The way we show our desire to follow in God’s way is through baptism and confirmation. When we are baptized and confirmed, we enter into a covenant that we will take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and that we will always remember Him and keep His commandments. We also promise to stand as witnesses of God at all times and to assist those in need (see Mosiah 18:8–9). In return, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. #### Commitments (Page 89) - Will you be baptized and confirmed? - Will you invite your friends and family to attend a baptismal service? If possible, invite investigators to attend a baptismal service and a sacrament meeting during which someone is confirmed. **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - All baptismal interview questions. - Invitation to Be Baptize: The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

How does the Holy Ghost help us understand the teachings of prophets and apostles?,"['Follow the Prophet (Page 89) Truth is a knowledge of things as they really are, were, and will be. It does not change with conditions or time. Truth is the same in every age and culture. God is the source of all truth. We can have faith in Him because we know He will teach us only truth. God wants all His children to know the truth. Therefore, He reveals the truths necessary for salvation through prophets and apostles. He reveals truth to us personally through the scriptures and personal revelation. A prophet is called and chosen by God and is a righteous man with great faith. The Lord reveals truth to him through the Holy Ghost. He commands His prophet to teach truth to all people. Those who believe God’s words as revealed through His prophet are blessed. Christ’s Church is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets, who direct the Church by revelation. The Lord called Joseph Smith as the first prophet and head of this last dispensation. His successors who lead The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today are also prophets and apostles. The President of the Church today is a living prophet. We are to have faith in God’s chosen prophet, gain conviction of his divine calling, and follow his teachings. We have frequent opportunities to sustain Church leaders publicly. Sustain means to support. We are to prepare ourselves so that when the prophets and apostles speak, the Holy Ghost can confirm the truths they teach, and we can then determine to follow the counsel they give us. Those who listen to and follow the counsel of living prophets and apostles will not go astray. The teachings of living prophets provide an anchor of eternal truth in a world of shifting values and help us avoid misery and sorrow. The confusion and strife of the world will not overwhelm us, and we can enjoy the assurance of being in harmony with God’s will. #### Scripture Study (Page 90) | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Mosiah 15:11-12 | D&C 21:1-7 | Ephesians 2:19-20 | | Alma 13:1-16 | D&C 136:37-38 | Ephesians 4:11-14 | | 3 Nephi 12:1-2 | John 15:16 | Hebrews 5:4 | | D&C 1:37-38 | Acts 10:34-44 | Amos 3:7 | **Commitments** - Will you meet the bishop? - Will you sustain and follow the counsel of Church leaders? **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God?

Wht did Matthew say abut the comandments?,"['Keep the Ten Commandments (Page 90) Heavenly Father gives us commandments so that we will know what to do and what to avoid in order to receive the blessings He wants to give us (joy, peace of conscience, lasting happiness). God revealed to Moses the Ten Commandments to guide His people: - “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3). Other “gods” can include possessions, power, or prominence. - “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” (Exodus 20:4). - “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” (Exodus 20:7). - “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8). - “Honour thy father and thy mother” (Exodus 20:12). - “Thou shalt not kill” (Exodus 20:13). - “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:14). - “Thou shalt not steal” (Exodus 20:15). - “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” (Exodus 20:16). - “Thou shalt not covet” (Exodus 20:17). The Ten Commandments are still valid today. They teach us to worship and show reverence for God. They also teach us how to treat one another. #### No Other Gods (Page 90) People in many cultures own or pay respect to objects that remind them of Deity or ancestors. Sometimes those objects, such as statues, religious emblems, or small shrines, might also be the focus of their worship. Help them understand that the Lord has commanded us not to worship idols. Encourage them to remove from their home any object they worship or to which they pray. Help them focus their faith and worship on their Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Teach them that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ focuses on the living Christ. In the restored gospel the Lord has taught us how to remember Him. We remember Him through prayer, the sacrament, and temple worship. Your mission president will provide guidance in specific areas. #### Scripture Study (Page 91) - Mosiah 13, D&C 59:5–6, Matthew 22:36–40, Exodus 20:1–17, Deuteronomy 5:6–21 **Commitment** - Will you keep the Ten Commandments? ## Live the Law of Chastity (Page 91) God delights in chastity and hates sexual sin. Chastity includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one’s spouse after marriage. Those who live the law of chastity enjoy the strength that comes from self-control. They enjoy confidence and trust in their family relationships. They can enjoy more fully the influence of the Holy Ghost in their lives. Those who break this law are subject to a lasting sense of shame and guilt that burdens their lives. Chastity requires faithfulness in thought and action. We must keep our thoughts clean and be modest in our dress, speech, and actions. We must avoid pornography in any form. We should treat the God-given procreative power and our bodies as sacred. Baptismal candidates are to live the law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman. They are not to participate in abortions or homosexual or lesbian relations. Those who have committed sexual sin can repent and be forgiven.']","In Matthew 22:36–40, it is highlighted as part of the scripture study related to the Ten Commandments."
What does Matthew 5:27-28 teach in the context of missionary training?,"['#### Couples Living Together (Page 91) Men and women who are living together but are not married may not be baptized without first getting married or separated.

[Note: A person who answers yes to either of these questions must be interviewed by the mission president before being baptized.] ## Obey the Word of Wisdom (Page 92) The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith a law of health called the Word of Wisdom. This law teaches us what foods and substances we should and should not use to maintain the health of our bodies and to keep us free from evil influences. The Lord promises blessings of health, strength, protection against evil, and greater receptiveness to spiritual truths. Remember that our bodies are sacred. We should treat them with respect and reverence. The Word of Wisdom teaches that we are to eat healthy foods. It teaches very specifically that we are to avoid harmful substances, including alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. We must also avoid harmful drugs in any form. To be baptized and confirmed, those you teach must give up these substances. People who obey the Word of Wisdom are more receptive to spiritual truths. Your mission president will answer questions about whether other specific substances in your culture are included in the Word of Wisdom. #### Overcoming Addictions (Page 92) You can best help those who are struggling to overcome smoking, alcohol, and other habits by following these principles. The suggestions below are applied particularly to the Word of Wisdom but can be adapted for other addictions as well. 1. Help the people set goals as to when and how they will live the Word of Wisdom. 2. Pray for them in your personal prayers and when you are with them. 3. Be positive and supportive—even if they relapse. 4. Continue teaching them the gospel. Teach them how to use prayer and faith as sources of strength. 5. Help them attend church regularly and develop friendships with people who live the Word of Wisdom and have overcome the same addiction. 6. As appropriate, offer to give them priesthood blessings. 7. Encourage them to remove harmful substances from their home. #### Scripture Study (Page 92) - D&C 89, 1 Corinthians 3:16–17, 1 Corinthians 6:19–20, **Commitment** - Will you live the Word of Wisdom? **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - What do you understand of the Word of Wisdom?

What does Genesis 14:18–20 teach about tithing?,"['Keep the Law of Tithing (Page 92) One of the great blessings of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the privilege of contributing to the growth of the kingdom of God through paying tithing. Tithing is an ancient, divine law. For example, the Old Testament prophet Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed (see Alma 13:15). To those who pay tithing, the Lord promises that He will “open . . . the windows of heaven, and pour . . . out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it” (Malachi 3:10). These blessings may be temporal or spiritual, but they will come to those who obey this divine law. Tithing means one-tenth, and the Lord has commanded us to give a tenth of our increase, which is understood to mean income, that we may be blessed. The law of tithing gives us the opportunity to help build His kingdom. Our tithes are holy to the Lord, and we honor Him by paying tithing. God promises to abundantly bless those who pay an honest tithe. Those who do not pay tithing rob God (see Malachi 3:8). They keep for themselves something that rightfully belongs to Him. We should seek first the kingdom of God, and tithing is an important way of doing that. Paying tithing is an expression of our faith. It is an outward sign of our belief in God and His work. Tithing funds are used to support the ongoing activities of the Church, such as building and maintaining temples and meetinghouses, carrying the gospel to all the world, con- ducting temple and family history work, and many other worldwide activities. Tithing does not pay local Church leaders, who serve without receiving payment of any kind. Local Church leaders send the tithing received each week directly to Church headquarters. A council comprised of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric determines specific ways to use the sacred tithing funds. #### Scripture Study (page 93) - Tithing: D&C 119, D&C 120, Hebrews 7:1–2, Genesis 14:18–20, Leviticus 27:30–33, Malachi 3:7–12 - Faith: 3 Nephi 13:33, Ether 12:6, **Commitment** - Will you live the law of tithing when you are baptized? **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - What do you understand of the law of tithing? Are you willing to obey this law? ## Observe the Law of the Fast (page 93) Great blessings are available to those who obey God’s commandment to fast. Fasting means going without food and drink for a period of time. Usually the first Sunday of each month is set aside as a special day to fast for two consecutive meals, pray, and bear testimony. Fasting and prayer go together. When we fast and pray with faith, we are more receptive to receiving answers to our prayers and blessings from the Lord. He promises us that He will guide us continually. We should fast and pray for specific purposes. Fasting is private and spiritual, and we should not draw attention to the fact that we are fasting. Pure religion includes caring for the poor. We are to help them meet their physical and spiritual needs. When we fast, we donate money to the Church for the care of the poor and the needy. We call this a fast offering. We give at least the amount of money we save by fasting for two meals. However, we need not limit our contribution to the cost of two meals. We are encouraged to be as generous as our means allow. By caring for the poor, we help fulfill our baptismal covenants and retain a remission of our sins. #### Scripture Study (Page 94) - Fasting: Omni 1:26, Alma 5:45–46, Alma 6:6, Alma 17:2–3, Moroni 6:5, D&C 59:12–16, D&C 88:76, Matthew 6:1–4, 16–18, Isaiah 58:6–11 - Caring for the Poor: Mosiah 4:16–27, Mosiah 18:8–10, Alma 4:12–13, Matthew 25:34–46, James 1:27, Isaiah 58:3–12 **Conmitments** - Will you fast and pray on the next fast Sunday for some special need? - Will you donate a generous fast offering [after you are baptized]? ##']","Genesis 14:18–20 is referenced in the context of tithing as an example of the ancient, divine law where the Old Testament prophet Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed."
"How do power and wisdom play a role in missionary work, and how can missionaries effectively find and teach those who are prepared to receive the restored gospel?","['<1-hop>\n\n. . ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (Alma 31:34–35). “Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message. Many of these people have been “kept from the truth [only] because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). Usually you do not know who these people are. They may not immediately recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They may not understand that greater peace, direction, and purpose in life will come through the restored gospel than from anything else. They often do not realize that they are looking for the restored gospel until they have found it. For example, one convert said, “When I heard the gospel, it filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t know was there.” Another said, “I have finished the search I didn’t know I was on.” Wherever you are assigned to serve, remember that the Lord has “suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in [Him] for the salvation of souls.” Work effectively to “lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that [the Lord] shall put in your hearts.” If you do, you will receive the promise that “you shall not be confounded before men,” and “it shall be given you . . . in the very moment, what ye shall say” (D&C 100:4–6). Finding by the Spirit is as important as teaching by the Spirit. As in teaching, your efforts in finding will be effective if you are guided by the Spirit. Have faith that you will know what to teach and what to do to find those who will receive you. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 170) Many of the members you visit may be converts to the Church. Plan a time to ask them how they came in contact with the Church and how they came to recognize that the missionaries were teaching them the truth. Summarize their experiences in your study journal. #### Scripture Study (Page 170) How are God’s children prepared and led to the restored gospel? - Alma 13:24, D&C 29:7, D&C 84:45-47, 88 - Alma 16:16-17, D&C 33:6, D&C 136:32-33 ##', '<2-hop>\n\nTalk with Everyone (Page 170) While the Prophet Joseph Smith was traveling with a group of missionaries on the Missouri River, the Lord revealed, “It is not needful for . . . mine elders to be moving swiftly . . . whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief” (D&C 61:3). As you move swiftly to planned activities, pray for the ability to see unplanned opportunities to serve and teach those who may be “perishing in unbelief.” Pray for the spiritual sensitivity to recognize opportunities. You will find that God will place in your path His children who are being prepared to receive the restored gospel. Nothing happens in missionary work until you find someone to teach. Talk with as many people as you can each day. It is natural to be somewhat apprehensive about talking to people, but you can pray for the faith and strength to be more bold in opening your mouth to proclaim the restored gospel. Try applying the following ideas as you seek to talk with everyone you meet: - Talk to people about their families. Help them see how the restored gospel can be a blessing to their families. - Look for clues—such as items in homes or yards, lettering on clothing, or indications of children—to help you know how to begin talking with people. - Listen sincerely to what people say to you. - Be warm, friendly, and cheerful. Offer to help. - Trust the Spirit to put into your heart and mind what to teach. - Invite everyone to learn about the restored gospel. - Offer pass-along cards. - Ask for the names of people’s acquaintances who might be interested in your message. As you read the following true account, look for how the man was prepared to receive the missionaries and how the missionaries used an unplanned opportunity to teach him the gospel. As a child, I was never taught to read the Bible. I went to church on Sundays, but I contributed nothing and felt nothing in return. I was disillusioned by my religion. . . . I searched for . . . God—wanting to know if He even existed. I thirsted to know Him and His words. But I could not seem to find what I sought. There were moments when I felt close to quenching my thirst. When I held my first child, a daughter, in my arms for the first time, I had a feeling that God really did exist. Many years later, when her sister was born, I experienced the same feeling. . . . Most of the time, however, an inexplicable tiredness weighed upon my soul. I was spiritually thirsty and could find no place to drink. In April 1994 I was living in the city of Monterrey, Mexico, earning a living as a taxi driver. One day it rained for hours, sending water cascading down the mountainsides. After driving around in the rain for hours, I found myself in a little town about eight kilometers (five miles) from Monterrey. It was about . . . nearly time to go home. Suddenly I saw two young men on foot. They were wearing dark trousers and white shirts, and they looked drenched from head to foot. When I approached them, I opened the door of the taxi and called, “Get in! I’m going to Monterrey.” The taller one, who had a very fair complexion, replied, “We don’t have any money.” “No charge,” I replied. They quickly got into the taxi. As I drove, we talked. They asked if they could share a message about Jesus Christ with me. I agreed and gave them my address. When I got home, I woke my wife and told her about the two young men. “What a coincidence,” I said. “One is Mexican and the other is American, and they are both named Elder.” “Elder means missionary,” my wife answered, knowing just a little about the Church. From deep within me, I felt something stir. These young men had left a feeling of exquisite wonder in my heart. I felt that I was close to finding the water that would quench my thirst, that it was within reach. The missionaries came to our home on 5 June, and I was happy to listen to them. Two weeks later, on 19 June, I was baptized. My wife was baptized four months later, in October. Our oldest daughter had been receiving religious training at a school. When she went to church for the first time, she cried, “Papa, this is so much better than what I am learning at school!” She too was baptized in October. In December 1995 we were sealed as a family in the Mexico City Mexico Temple for this life and for eternity. Now we are a family enjoying harmony, peace, and happiness. We know who we worship. We know where we came from and where we are going. We love God’s word, especially the Book of Mormon, and we love His Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Through these gifts we have found that well of living water the Savior spoke of to the woman of Samaria: “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:14). [Victor Manuel Cabrera, “Thirsting for the Living Water,” Ensign, Aug. 2001, 60–61] ####', '<3-hop>\n\nGo About Doing Good (Page 182) Your faith to find people to teach is demonstrated through your actions. During His mortal ministry, the Savior “took upon him the form of a servant” (Philippians 2:7). He went about “doing good” (Acts 10:38) and “preaching the gospel” (Matthew 4:23). As you follow this example, you will find those who will receive you. Through service, you and those who are prepared for the restored gospel come together in a powerful, inspiring way. Your good works will help people recognize you as a servant of God and will lead to opportunities to teach the restored gospel. Many missionaries’ experience with service before their missions involved planned “service projects,” such as helping someone move, serving at a Church farm, or cleaning a yard. As a missionary, you will offer such planned service each week (see the Missionary Handbook for additional information). The type of service described in this section focuses on unplanned opportunities. This type of service involves listening to the Spirit to recognize opportunities for small, simple acts of kindness that you can offer to God’s children. Pray and be aware of opportunities throughout each day to do good. As you seek to do good, you will be led to people who are being prepared for the restored gospel. As you read the following account, note how the missionaries “did good” and preached the gospel. *“Do you want to be happy? Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause. Lend your efforts to helping people. . . . Stand higher, lift those with feeble knees, hold up the arms of those that hang down. Live the gospel of Jesus Christ.” – PRESIDENT GORDON B. HINCKLEY TEACHINGS OF GORDON B. HINCKLEY, 597* *Pablo came regularly to our weekly English class. He was a retired gentleman who was learning English to help keep his mind off his concern for his ailing wife. One week he quit coming. No one seemed to know why. About a month later, he came to class again. He looked different. He had lost weight, and he looked depressed. He didn’t participate in class as he had before, and he left class before we could talk with him. During the following week, my companion and I prayed that Pablo would come back to class so we could talk to him. Our prayers were answered as he came to the next class. As we talked with him after class, he shared that his wife had died. He told us a little bit about the experience, and we expressed our sympathy. We told him that we wanted to help him understand how he could be with his wife again. He raised his head, looked in my eyes, and with tears of anger and sadness said, “If you really want to help me, you would come over to my house and help me get my life back in order. Isn’t that what missionaries do? I need help getting my house and affairs in order.” We were surprised and humbled by Pablo’s comments. We offered our help for anything he needed. I think that was the point he started trusting our intentions. He told us to be over at his house the next day to help him prune his trees. We went to his house at the appointed time and began working at his side. In the months he took care of his wife, he had neglected chores around his yard and home. There was plenty of work for the three of us to do. This became a weekly service experience at his home. We pruned trees, pulled weeds, and picked fruit. We didn’t start teaching—whenever we tried to start, he quickly ended our conversations. He was most comfortable as we spoke about his life and family. Mostly, we just listened. After about a month and a half, Pablo surprised us by asking, “Will I really see my wife again?” We joyously responded that he would. We testified of eternal families and did our best to answer his questions. We taught Pablo the plan of salvation. He was moved by the doctrine. Before we left he had a list of questions he wanted answered, such as, “Will my wife have a body when I see her again?” and “Will we be free from illness and pain?” We answered his questions and set up another appointment to discuss the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Shortly thereafter, Pablo’s countenance changed. He smiled more often and seemed more at peace. He actually had “hope for a better world” (Ether 12:4). Our service helped him trust the things we taught.* Believe that people who are being prepared to receive the message of the Restoration will be placed in your path. God will also place you where your good acts and words will prepare people to receive missionaries and Church members. In all your finding efforts, pray and look for opportunities to serve, help, and lift others. As you are serving, talk with everyone you meet. Have the faith that you can share the restored gospel. In every way you serve, you should do so because you love your brothers and sisters and therefore hope, pray, and earnestly desire to teach them the restored gospel. ####', '<4-hop>\n\nGuidelines (Page 183) Remember the following guidelines as you seek to do good: - Stay with your companion. - Preserve the sacred nature of your call. - Keep the missionary rules, and do not donate or use your money. - See your Missionary Handbook for guidelines concerning weekly community service. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 183) - In what ways did the missionaries in this account “do good”? - What role did service play in Pablo’s decision to be taught the gospel? - Do you look for opportunities to do good throughout each day? Can you improve in this area? Write in your study journal or discuss with your companion how you can do more good throughout the day to find more people to teach. #### Scripture Study (Page 184) - What was the role of service in the Savior’s life? - 3 Nephi 17:7, 21; Matthew 8:1–4, Matthew 9:1–8, Mark 1:21–28, John 4:46–54 - What was the role of service in Ammon’s and Aaron’s missions? - Alma 17:19–25, Alma 18:8–10, Alma 22:3 - What does the Lord ask you to do? - 3 Nephi 27:21 ## No Effort Is Wasted (Page 184) When people choose not to investigate the restored gospel, your work is not wasted. Your consistent efforts in serving and teaching as many people as you can is one way God prepares His children to eventually receive His servants. He often reaches out to His children through you. Even when people do not accept the opportunity to learn the gospel, your service and words are evidence of God’s love for them and may plant seeds that future missionaries and members of the Church will harvest. When people do not accept the gospel, do not be discouraged. You have raised a warning voice. You have given them a clear choice. Disciples of Christ feel sorrow when people choose not to repent, but they maintain a vision of who they are and what they are doing. They continue to diligently move forward. #### Remember This (Page 184) - Build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). - Seek for and follow the Spirit when finding. - People in your area are being prepared to receive the restored gospel. - Church members—including those who are active, less active, prospective elders, and recent converts—are your best resources for finding people to teach, baptize, and confirm. - Develop a strong relationship with the bishop and members. - Teach when you find, and find when you teach. - Be aware of unplanned finding opportunities. - Pray for opportunities to do good and to preach the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. - There are many ways to find people to teach. Avoid focusing on just one or two approaches. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 185) ### Personal Study (Page 185) Read the following letter from a missionary to her parents: *“I taught a wonderful lady on the bus. We were coming back from district meeting, and it was the only empty seat so I sat down and started to look at my mail. Of course, the first one to be read was yours, with the baby pictures of Evan. I noticed that the eyes next to me were also looking at the pictures, and I looked over to meet eyes with an older woman. She gave me a half smile and looked out the window.']","Power and wisdom are essential in missionary work as they enable missionaries to bring people back to the Lord, as highlighted in Alma 31:34–35. Missionaries are encouraged to find 'them that will receive you' (D&C 42:8), recognizing that many people are kept from the truth because they do not know where to find it (D&C 123:12). Effective missionary work involves being guided by the Spirit in both finding and teaching. Missionaries are advised to talk with everyone, pray for spiritual sensitivity to recognize opportunities, and trust the Spirit to guide their actions and words. Service plays a crucial role, as demonstrated by missionaries who engage in unplanned acts of kindness, which help build trust and open opportunities to teach the restored gospel. By following the Savior's example of doing good and preaching the gospel, missionaries can find those who are prepared to receive their message."
How do Christlike attributes and the Atonement of Christ help missionaries teach the restored gospel effectively?,"['<1-hop>\n\nYou are called to teach the restored gospel to as many people as will receive you. Teaching is central to everything you do. You develop Christlike attributes, study the missionary lessons, improve your ability to speak in your mission language, and rely on the Spirit in order to teach with convincing power. The Lord stated this very simply as a commandment with a promise: “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the [missionary lessons] but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). Learn to rely on the Spirit to give you what you should say and do. By studying, developing, and using the teaching skills in this chapter, you will become a more capable instrument in the hands of the Lord. The Spirit will draw upon the knowledge and skills you have developed to help you teach more powerfully. The quality and power of your teaching will help others understand and feel the importance the restored gospel has for them. Their understanding will be influenced by your personal worthiness. Their understanding will also be influenced by how well you focus your attention on them, by how well you explain the gospel, use the scriptures, share your testimony, ask questions, and invite them to make and keep commitments. #### Follow the Spirit (Page 190) “The Spirit is the most important single element in this work. With the Spirit magnifying your call, you can do miracles for the Lord in the mission field. Without the Spirit, you will never succeed regardless of your talent and ability” (Ezra Taft Benson, seminar for new mission presidents, 25 June 1986). #### Invite the Spirit (Page 190) The following suggestions will help you invite the Spirit as you teach: - Pray. - Use the scriptures. - Bear testimony. - Share experiences. - Express love for the Lord and for others. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nHow to Begin Teaching (Page 190) The first few moments with investigators are very important. Investigators must learn to trust you. Begin your first visit in a warm, respectful, genuine manner. Ask a few simple questions to help you understand their religious background and their expectations regarding your visits. For example, ask, “What role has religion played in your life?” Do not, however, ask personal questions that would make them uncomfortable. Before you begin, ask all who are present to join with you in the lesson. Encourage them to turn off the television and remove other distractions so that the Spirit of the Lord will not be hindered. Explain that you would like to begin and end each lesson in prayer. Suggest that you will offer the opening prayer. Pray simply but fervently that the Lord will bless the people you are teaching in every aspect of their lives, and especially that they can feel the truth of what you will teach. Demonstrate sincere interest and love for the investigators and faith in the converting power of the gospel (see Moroni 7:43–48). As guided by the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following to your investigators: - Because God is our Heavenly Father, we are all brothers and sisters. We would like to refer to you as brothers and sisters. - Each person we teach has personal challenges and concerns. No matter what your needs or concerns might be, the Savior and His teachings—the gospel—will help you. - Our message will enable you to improve the quality of your lives. It will help you deal with the problems and challenges that we all face in life. - Our message, which is centered in Jesus Christ, is of great value and importance. - We all make mistakes in life, and these mistakes create feelings of guilt and shame. These feelings cannot be relieved without repentance and forgiveness. They can be fully healed through the Atonement of Christ. - Our message cannot be learned all at once. Understanding will come over time through prayer, study, experience, and keeping God’s commandments. - We have weaknesses, as everyone does. We may not speak the language very well or be able to answer every question you have. But we have been called by a prophet of God to share what we know. We know that our message is true. - We will be guides so that you can learn the truth of our message for yourselves. It is your choice to accept and act on the message. Therefore, you should feel free to ask questions. - As you sincerely seek to understand our message, you may face challenges, but God will help you. - As you accept our message, you will learn how to make covenants, or promises, with God. You will learn how to make changes to bring your lives in closer harmony with His teachings. You will want to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be baptized by proper authority (see John 3:5). Before teaching the doctrines in a lesson, consider giving a simple overview of what you are going to teach. Help people see that it will have personal relevance for them. Many of the investigators you teach have been prepared by the Lord (see Alma 16:16–17). As you share spiritual experiences together in the first meeting, they will recognize you as servants of the Lord. ####']","Christlike attributes and the Atonement of Christ play a crucial role in helping missionaries teach the restored gospel effectively. By developing Christlike attributes, missionaries can teach with convincing power, as they rely on the Spirit to guide their words and actions. This is emphasized in the guidance to 'seek to obtain my word' and to 'treasure up in your minds continually the words of life,' allowing the Spirit to direct their teaching (D&C 11:21, D&C 84:85). Furthermore, the Atonement of Christ is central to the message missionaries share, as it offers a way for individuals to overcome personal challenges and find healing through repentance and forgiveness. This understanding helps missionaries convey the importance of the gospel in improving lives and dealing with life's challenges, as they express love and demonstrate faith in the converting power of the gospel. By embodying these principles, missionaries can effectively invite the Spirit and help others feel the truth of their teachings."
How can missionaries effectively build faith in Jesus Christ among less-active members while coordinating with local priesthood leaders?,"['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 236) - During ward council meeting, ask the bishop if there are any less-active members in your area he would like you to visit this week. As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for yourself and for others. - Rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Be exactly obedient. • Study the language of your mission each day. - Plan every day and focus on the key indicators. - Work effectively all day, every day. - Ask for referrals from everyone! - Teach when you find; find when you teach. - Read the Book of Mormon with those you teach. - Teach people that an important way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. - Contact every investigator daily. - Bear testimony frequently. - Have a member at every lesson possible. - Always set specific dates and times for the next lesson. - Invite all investigators to baptismal services. - After each lesson, provide investigators with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. - Build relationships with members by serving them and working with the leadership of the ward. - Help ward leaders with retention and activation activities. - Help everyone you teach make commitments that will bring about repentance and will strengthen their faith in the Savior. - Love the Lord and serve Him the very best you can.', '<3-hop>\n\nWe discover that there is no one person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration and anger that we leave. We go back to the world from which we came, where we knew who we were, where we contributed, and where we could speak the language” [Ensign, May 1999, 108].* #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 229) Read the previous account. Write answers to the following questions in your study journal, or discuss them with your companion. Make appropriate goals and plans. - According to this account, what are some of the factors that make it difficult for new members to remain active? - How can having members involved from the beginning of the teaching process help with these challenges? - Think of those you are teaching. How can you better involve members to help investigators begin to make the social transition into the Church? ## Home and Visiting Teaching (Page 229) Stake presidents and bishops, coordinating with the mission president, may use missionaries to visit less-active and part-member families. In appropriate situations, they may request that full-time missionaries participate in home teaching and in visiting teaching. These teaching opportunities should strengthen members, increase the ability of the missionaries to teach, and help missionaries obtain referrals (see “Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). ##', '<4-hop>\n\nWork with the Ward Council to Strengthen New and Less-Active Members (Page 229) Teaching and baptizing investigators is under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity together. You may often be invited to attend ward council and priesthood executive committee meetings. Your first priority is to make sure that your investigators are at Church. Frequently this will mean that you will accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council or priesthood executive committee. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: *“Every new convert needs three things: “1. A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems. “2. An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. . . . “3. Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (Moro. 6:4). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism” (Ensign, May 1999, 106).* The ward council will take the lead in providing a friend, responsibility, and spiritual nourishment for new converts. You will help them as requested. Priesthood leaders and members will do the fellowshipping, with your assistance. ### Friendship (Page 230) - Before baptism and confirmation, ensure that members are present at every lesson, if possible. These members should be with the investigators often to answer their questions, understand their challenges, and encourage them. - Invite members to attend the baptismal service and to welcome new converts into the ward. Members help new converts feel comfortable in various Church meetings. They should also introduce them to other members. - Introduce the investigators to the bishop, his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and other ward leaders as soon as possible. Explain the roles of the bishop and other ward leaders. ### Opportunities to Serve (Page 230) • Help male converts understand and prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. Explain that priesthood quorums provide opportunities to learn, worship, and serve together. • Involve new converts and less-active members in service opportunities such as helping a widow or someone who is ill or participating in welfare projects. • Refer converts to family history consultants so they might complete a family group record and pedigree chart. If circumstances allow, help them prepare to be baptized in the temple for their deceased ancestors. • Invite converts to prepare family members and friends to be taught by the missionaries. The missionaries should ask new converts and less-active members for referrals. ### Nourishment by the Word of God (Page 230) - Finish teaching the principles in lesson 5, “Laws and Ordinances.” - Remind new converts and less-active members of commitments they made before baptism and the covenants they made when they were baptized and confirmed. - Encourage them to pray daily as individuals and with their families. - Encourage them to study the scriptures daily, especially the Book of Mormon. - Strengthen new converts’ testimonies of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Review the lessons that you taught before baptism and confirmation, adapting the commitment invitations to their current needs. - Continue to teach the importance of attending church each Sunday and worthily partaking of the sacrament. Attend and sit with new converts or less-active members. - Invite them to attend the Gospel Principles class during Sunday School. - Teach them how to hold family home evening on Monday nights using the Family Home Evening Resource Book. - Encourage them to share the restored gospel with others. - Help them enroll in seminary or institute classes. - Make them aware of Church resources such as www.mormon.org, www.lds.org, and www.familysearch.org. #### Scripture Study (Page 231) - Nourish with God’s - Mosiah 18:18-20, Alma 31:5, Moroni 6:4 - Service - Mosiah 2:17, Matthew 25:40, Topical Guide, “Serve” and “Service” ##', '<5-hop>\n\nWhat Is the Role of the Full-Time Mission President? (Page 231) The full-time mission president holds the keys for convert baptisms. Under his direction, full-time missionaries have primary responsibility for teaching investigators. However, the bishop oversees the progress and friendshipping of investigators as they are being taught. The ward mission plan is carried out under the presiding authority of the bishop. The mission president meets regularly with stake presidents to make sure that full-time missionaries cooperate with local priesthood leaders. He coordinates proselyting efforts and offers to help the stake president provide instruction in the principles and practices of missionary work. ## What Are the Responsibilities of Stake and Ward Leaders? (Page 231) Local Church leaders and members are your best allies. Respect them and strive to build good relationships with them. As you work with these leaders, remember that they have other responsibilities associated with their callings. Seek to be a blessing, not a burden, to the leaders of your stake and ward. Your attitude should be one of, “How can we help?” Counsel with the bishop and ward mission leader concerning your plans and activities. Make sure that what you do supports the ward mission plan. The roles of local priesthood leadership in missionary work are described below. Understanding their roles will help you better work with them. ### Stake President (Page 231) The stake president oversees bishops in their missionary, retention, and activation responsibilities. In his monthly interview with bishops, he discusses plans and the progress of specific investigators and members. He ensures that the doctrines relating to missionary work are taught regularly in stake and ward meetings and that priesthood leaders and others are trained in their missionary responsibilities. The stake president also meets regularly with the mission president to coordinate missionary efforts, including the training of leaders and members, use and placement of full-time missionaries, and assistance in activation efforts. ### High Councilor (Page 232) A high councilor is assigned by the stake presidency to promote missionary, retention, and activation work in the stake. He regularly reports the progress of this work to the stake presidency. He also ensures that ward mission leaders are properly trained in their duties, including the preparation of a ward mission plan.', '<6-hop>\n\nWe were coming back from district meeting, and it was the only empty seat so I sat down and started to look at my mail. Of course, the first one to be read was yours, with the baby pictures of Evan. I noticed that the eyes next to me were also looking at the pictures, and I looked over to meet eyes with an older woman. She gave me a half smile and looked out the window. She then closed her eyes like she was going to sleep. I prayed, ‘Heavenly Father, I want to talk to her. Please help me.’ A minute later she opened her eyes and sat up straight, and I quickly said, ‘Don’t you think he is cute?’ I showed her the pictures of baby Evan and started talking about families with her. I asked her about her kids, and she got teary-eyed and told me a story about how her daughter hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She cried and I cried with her. I told her about the plan of salvation and how Heavenly Father knows her and knows what she is going through. I cried and told her that I know that her daughter loves her because I am a daughter of a mother that loves me, and I love her. I explained that sometimes people make bad decisions and that her daughter has agency. She told me, smiling, ‘I bet your mother really misses you, and she will not let you go when she sees you again.’ She thanked me for talking with her and gave me her address so that we can share the gospel with her. As she was getting off the bus, she said, ‘I got on the wrong bus, but I didn’t get off. No one sat by me until you came . . . and look what happened.’ God’s plan is perfect!”* What principles from this chapter do you see in this account? Review the chapter and make a list in your study journal. Which of these principles can you try to apply today? - Read John 15:12–13; 21:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2; and Mosiah 18:8–10. How well are you fulfilling your responsibility to love and serve others? How can you improve? Write your response in your study journal. - How will people know that you are a servant of the Lord? As you ponder this question, study Moroni 7:3–5; Matthew 7:20; John 13:34–35. Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Read 3 Nephi 18:31–32; Alma 8:16; Alma 24:7–8; and Alma 32:41. Consider what these verses teach about working with former investigators. Record what you learn in your study journal and teach it to your companion. ### Companion Study (Page 185) - Using your daily planner, make plans to meet with recent converts. Ask them to share how they were prepared for the gospel. Ask questions like: When did you first come in contact with the Church? What finally convinced you to meet with missionaries? Write what you learn in your study journal. - Review each of the following topics. Using the lessons, prepare a simple finding approach. Practice teaching in a finding setting and quickly relating each topic to the Restoration. - Feeling a need for more direction and purpose in life. - Wanting to draw nearer to God. - Needing help with important decisions. - Read pages 66–68 of Our Search for Happiness and pages 59–64 of True to the Faith to better understand the doctrinal foundation of family history work. Prepare a talk on family history work, and share it with your companion. - Imagine that you and your companion are transferred into a new area. You find the area book in good condition, but you have no investigators. What would you do to add people to your teaching pool as rapidly as possible? Make plans to implement some of these ideas today. - The following idea has been successful for many missionaries and members. Read and study this idea with your companion. - Help members make a list of friends, relatives, and acquaintances with whom they could share the gospel. Review this list with the members, and help them prayerfully select someone they would like to prepare to hear the gospel. - Help them set a day by which they will (a) work to have the person or family prepared to be taught in their home or (b) do some other fellowshipping activity to prepare them. Setting a date gives members a goal and helps them exercise faith. - Help them plan what they will do between now and the date they have set. - Follow up with them regularly to support and encourage them. Invite them to share their successes and concerns. Discuss how you can apply this idea in the area in which you are serving. ###', '<7-hop>\n\nDistrict Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 186) - Read and discuss the “Finding through Your Own Efforts” section. - Discuss how these ideas have helped missionaries find people to teach. - On a chalkboard, list other ideas for finding people to teach. Invite the missionaries to demonstrate their ideas. - Invite the missionaries to set personal goals for improving their finding efforts. - Create a list of finding situations. - Assign each missionary one of the situations. Allow each missionary 5 minutes to prepare how he or she would teach the message of the Restoration. Refer them to “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ” lesson if needed. - Emphasize the importance of keeping the length of the message appropriate to the setting. For example, missionaries might spend more time teaching in a member’s home than they would teaching someone in the store. - Allow as many missionaries as time permits to teach the message of the Restoration in their assigned situation. - Teach the principles found in the “Teach When You Find, Find When You Teach” section. - Assign each missionary to prepare a one-minute message he or she could share in a finding setting. These messages should be based on the doctrine found in the missionary lessons. - Invite the missionaries to practice sharing their one-minute message with each other. You may want to set up a variety of finding settings, such as teaching in a member’s home, teaching on a doorstep, teaching on a sidewalk, or contacting a referral. Have the missionaries practice teaching in each of these settings. ### Mission President (Page 187) - Set an example of member-missionary work in your family. Share your experiences with the missionaries and members. - Counsel with priesthood leaders as to the best way for missionaries to find people to teach in your mission. - Organize missionary firesides at which you can speak to the investigators in your mission. Coordinate with local priesthood leaders to make the fireside available to members who can bring their friends. As part of these firesides, have recent converts bear testimony and tell their conversion stories before you speak. Focus your remarks on the message of the Restoration. - Share your four-generation chart with missionaries, and explain how you use it in your finding efforts. - Occasionally go with the missionaries to help them find people to teach. > Beginning of chapter 10 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Can I Improve My Teaching Skills? (Page 189) #### Consider This (Page 189) - How should I teach from the scriptures? - Why should I ask questions when I teach? - What types of questions should I ask? - How can I listen better to those I teach and to the Spirit? - How can I help people resolve their concerns? - How can I help others overcome bad habits and addictions?']","Missionaries can effectively build faith in Jesus Christ among less-active members by working closely with local priesthood leaders to ensure a coordinated effort. According to the context, missionaries are encouraged to visit less-active members, seeking to build their faith in Jesus Christ and asking for referrals. They should also work with local priesthood leaders to encourage new converts to be ordained to the priesthood, receive home teachers, and participate in temple work. Additionally, missionaries should be involved in ward council meetings and coordinate with the ward mission leader to ensure that less-active members are supported and have opportunities for spiritual nourishment and service. By fostering relationships with members and involving them in the teaching process, missionaries can help less-active members regain their desire and purpose in the gospel."
How does the study of scriptures and the Book of Mormon enhance a missionary's understanding and teaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ?,"['<1-hop>\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 19) The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work. The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will, and His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 20) What is the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ? - Read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27:13–22 for answers to the question. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion (Page 117) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (History of the Church, 2:52). An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge- shaped pieces that lean against each other. The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways: - Witness of Christ. “The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.” - Fulness of doctrine. “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (D&C 20:9 [;27:5].) . . . In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation. And they are taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.” - Foundation of testimony. “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” (A Witness and a Warning [1988], 18–19). The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach investigators. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach investigators. | Missionary Lesson | Doctrines | References | | --- | --- | --- | | The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ | Apostasy, Restoration, Joseph Smith, priesthood authority | 1 Nephi 12-14 2 Nephi 3; 26-29 Mosiah 18 | | The Plan of Salvation | The “great plan of the eternal God,” including the Fall of Adam, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the Judgment | 2 Nephi 2; 9 Mosiah 3; 15 Alma 12; 40-42 | | The Gospel of Jesus Christ | Faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end | 2 Nephi 31-32 3 Nephi 11; 27 | | The Commandments; Laws and Ordinances | Ordinances such as baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament | 3 Nephi 11:22-28; 18 Moroni 2-6 |', '<4-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 39) 1.

(Page 43) The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrines, principles, and commandments that you are to study, believe, love, live, and teach. They are what the living prophets and apostles have directed you to teach. They are organized so that you can help others clearly understand the doctrines of Christ. The lessons in this chapter are: 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 2. The Plan of Salvation 3. The Gospel of Jesus Christ 4. The Commandments 5. Laws and Ordinances Teach the first four lessons before baptism. Make sure those you teach qualify for baptism and confirmation by making and keeping all of the commitments in these lessons. Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching lessons before baptism with the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, new members are taught the first four lessons again, as well as “Laws and Ordinances.” Ward leaders determine whether ward missionaries or full-time missionaries lead out in ensuring that these lessons are taught and how long full-time missionaries are involved. Encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons. You should also use these lessons in individual and companion study, district meetings, and other training settings. As you study the scriptures and treasure up in your mind the doctrines in these lessons, the Spirit will give you in the very hour what you should say and do to help others receive a witness of the truthfulness of the teachings. As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and prepare to teach, keep firmly in mind these instructions. Make sure that you teach all the doctrines in these lessons. Unless directed by the Spirit, for each of the first three lessons, you should give the full content in the order in which they are written. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Each lesson outlines the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrines that you are to teach. Thoroughly learn the doctrines. Consistently focus on helping those you teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview questions to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation. The lessons also have ideas for teaching. Use these suggestions to strengthen how you prepare and teach. ###', '<7-hop>\n\nThe Role of Memorization (Page 44) Memorize scriptures to use in your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal points in each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language should focus their language study on preparing to teach the missionary lessons. They should memorize vocabu- lary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons. ### Teach with Clarity (Page 44) At the end of the first three lessons is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to make the message easy to understand. ### Scripture Study (Page 44) What are you directed to teach? Study Mosiah 18:18–20, D&C 43:15–16 and D&C 52:9 to find the answers to this question. Why must you study the doctrines in the lessons? Study Alma 17:2–3 and D&C 84:85 to find answers to this question. > Lesson One # 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 45) ## Your Purpose (Page 45) As you teach, prepare your investigators to meet the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the baptismal interview questions. This is best accomplished by inviting your investigators to make and keep the commitments listed below. ### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 45) - Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father?']","The study of scriptures and the Book of Mormon significantly enhances a missionary's understanding and teaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ by providing a comprehensive foundation of the gospel's doctrines and principles. According to the context, the Book of Mormon is described as 'the keystone of our religion,' holding the Church's teachings together and providing a powerful witness of Jesus Christ. It contains the 'fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ,' teaching doctrines plainly and simply, which is essential for missionaries as they teach investigators. Furthermore, scripture study is emphasized as a means to gain spiritual insights and blessings, as missionaries are encouraged to read and discuss passages that highlight the value of studying the word of God. This study helps missionaries to teach with clarity and conviction, using their own words as prompted by the Spirit, and to prepare investigators for baptism by ensuring they understand and commit to the gospel's teachings."
"How can missionaries effectively build faith in Jesus Christ among less-active members and new converts, and what role does structured missionary work play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 236) - During ward council meeting, ask the bishop if there are any less-active members in your area he would like you to visit this week. As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for yourself and for others. - Rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Be exactly obedient. • Study the language of your mission each day. - Plan every day and focus on the key indicators. - Work effectively all day, every day. - Ask for referrals from everyone! - Teach when you find; find when you teach. - Read the Book of Mormon with those you teach. - Teach people that an important way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. - Contact every investigator daily. - Bear testimony frequently. - Have a member at every lesson possible. - Always set specific dates and times for the next lesson. - Invite all investigators to baptismal services. - After each lesson, provide investigators with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. - Build relationships with members by serving them and working with the leadership of the ward. - Help ward leaders with retention and activation activities. - Help everyone you teach make commitments that will bring about repentance and will strengthen their faith in the Savior. - Love the Lord and serve Him the very best you can.', '<3-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching.

He wants you to watch over your area with love and great care. Your purpose is to help others come unto Him through baptism and confirmation. Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it. Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you. As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders. Your missionary call letter states: “You will also be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs. As you do these things the Lord will bless you and you will become an effective advocate and messenger of the truth. We place in you our confidence and pray that the Lord will help you meet your responsibilities in fulfilling this sacred assignment.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study Read Jacob 5:11–13, 61–64, 74–75, and answer these questions: - How does the Lord feel about His children? - What kind of effort does the Lord require of His servants? ##']","Missionaries can effectively build faith in Jesus Christ among less-active members and new converts by engaging in activities such as visiting less-active members, seeking to build their faith, and asking for referrals, as suggested in the Companion Study section. Structured missionary work plays a crucial role in this process by providing a framework for missionaries to follow, such as working with local priesthood leaders to encourage new converts to participate in church activities, receive home teachers, and prepare for temple ordinances. Additionally, missionaries are encouraged to rely on the Spirit, pray often, and bear testimony frequently, which helps strengthen the faith of those they teach. By following these structured guidelines and focusing on personal engagement, missionaries can help less-active members and new converts regain their 'desire and purpose' to live the gospel."
How can missionaries effectively incorporate a language study plan to enhance their missionary work and language skills?,"['<1-hop>\n\n- Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. - Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards. - Pray sincerely for divine assistance. - Study, practice, and use the mission language each day. ## Be Dedicated and Diligent (Page 142) Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort. Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language takes time. Be patient with yourself. Seek the help of your companion, members, investigators, and other missionaries. Do not stop improving your language skills once people begin to understand you. As your ability to speak the language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it. You will be less worried about how to communicate the feelings that are in your heart. You will be better able to respond to the needs of investigators and the promptings of the Spirit. Strive to master the language throughout your mission and after you return. The Lord has invested much in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your life. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained: “We would . . . hope that every missionary learning a new proselyting language would master it in every way possible. . . . And as you do so, your proselyting and testifying skills will improve. You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive to your investigators. . . . Don’t be satisfied with what we call a missionary vocabulary only. Stretch yourself in the language, and you will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (missionary satellite broadcast, Aug. 1998). You are not alone in learning your mission language. Whenever the Lord gives a commandment, He provides a way to accomplish it (see 1 Nephi 3:7). Seek His help. Be dedicated in your study. In time you will acquire the language skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. ## Learn English (Page 142) If you do not speak English, you should study it as a missionary. This will bless you during your mission and throughout your life. Learning English will enable you to help build the Lord’s kingdom in additional ways and will be a blessing for you and your family. Many of the suggestions found in this chapter will help you. Focus particularly on the following: - Set a goal to speak English with your companion. If your companion already knows English and is trying to learn your language, you might choose to speak English in the apartment and the mission language when you go out. - With your companion, read from the Book of Mormon in English. You might also choose to alternate: You read a verse in English, and then your companion reads a verse in the mission language. Correct each other’s pronunciation and intonation. - Ask your mission president for suggestions on a simple English grammar text if you do not already have one. ## Principles of Language Learning (Page 142) This section describes principles to help you study and learn the language more effectively. - **Take responsibility.** Regularly create or adjust your language learning goals and study plan. Strive to use the language at every opportunity. - **Make your study meaningful.** Ask yourself: Why am I studying this? How will it help me communicate better? Relate what you study to real-life situations and daily activities. Study parts of the language that will help you say what you want to say. For example, if there is a scripture story you would like to include in your teaching, learn the vocabulary and grammar necessary to relate it. - Seek to communicate. Seek to find an appropriate balance between studying grammar and the structure of the language and learning through your daily activities. There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language. - Learn new concepts thoroughly. You will be able to recall and effectively use language principles if you review regularly what you have studied and if you practice again in new situations. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nCreate a Language Study Plan (Page 143) A language study plan helps both new and experienced missionaries focus on what they can do each day to improve their ability to speak the mission language. Your plan will include what you will do during your language study time and what you will do throughout the day. As needed, use some of your language study time to create or adjust your study plan. Then each morning during your language study time, learn the language needed for the day’s activities. The following guidelines will help you in creating your own language learning plan: 1. Set goals. Weekly and daily goals will help you learn your mission language. Focus your goals on improving your ability to communicate and teach during scheduled activities, such as teaching appointments, finding opportunities, and ward council meetings. Review your progress in achieving your language goals. Ask yourself what you can do to communicate with greater clarity and power during your scheduled activities. 2. Select which tools to use. Review the following language tools and determine which you can use to achieve your goals: - The standard works in your mission language. - The lessons in your mission language. - A pocket-size dictionary. - A small grammar book. - MTC language materials. - Note cards. - A pocket notebook. - Other Church materials in your mission language. 3. Memorize vocabulary and phrases. Identify vocabulary and phrases that will help you accomplish your goals. Your language plan might include the following ideas: - Identify vocabulary and phrases in the lessons, brochures, scriptures, and other Church publications that you can use in teaching. - Record words or phrases you do not know in a notebook. Carry a small dictionary and look up these words. - Carry note cards to study throughout the day. Write a word or phrase on one side and the definition on the opposite side. Set aside the words you learn. Work on the remaining words until you know them all. - Use new words and phrases in sentences during personal study, teaching, and throughout the day. - Practice pronunciation by saying new words and phrases out loud. - Memorize key scriptures in the mission language. - Memorize simple statements from the lessons or brochures that convey key gospel principles. Find other ways to express these ideas. 4. Learn grammar. Use your language tools to identify grammar principles that will help you achieve your goals. If needed, ask your companion, an experienced missionary, or a member for help. Consider incorporating some of the following ideas: - Use the grammar text you received at the MTC or a text approved by your mission president to help you understand the grammar and sentence patterns found in the lessons, brochures, and scriptures. - Prepare sentences to use in your scheduled activities that apply these grammar principles. Practice speaking and writing the sentences. - Pay attention to word order in the language and to words and their parts. - Look for opportunities to practice and apply the grammar that you study each day. 5. Actively listen. Consider incorporating the following: - Listen carefully to native speakers. Imitate what you hear. - When you hear something you do not understand, write it down and find out what it means. Practice using the vocabulary or sentence pattern. - When listening, identify vocabulary and patterns that you have recently learned. - When you hear a phrase expressed differently from the way you would say it, write it down and practice it. However, as a servant of the Lord, always use appropriate language, not slang. - Make a list of things people might say to you during your planned activities. Look up words and phrases related to these responses. Plan and practice ways that you could respond. 6. Improve your ability to read and write. Read the Book of Mormon in your mission language to learn vocabulary and phrases and to practice grammar, pronunciation, and fluency. There is great power in using the scriptures in your language study. Also consider the following ideas: - Learn to read and write the alphabet, script, or characters of your language. For character-based writing systems, focus on reading skills, such as scripture reading, that will help you when you teach. - Read out loud from the Book of Mormon, other scriptures, or Church magazines in your mission language. Pay attention to unfamiliar vocabulary, phrases, and grammar. If you do not understand a word, try to understand its meaning from the context of the passage before you look it up. Add the word to your note cards. Use your native- language and mission-language scriptures side-by-side if necessary. - Have someone coach you on pronunciation, intonation, and pauses as you read. - Practice writing in your mission language—for example, personal notes and reminders, letters, thank-you notes, and notes of encouragement. Write your testimony in copies of the Book of Mormon that you distribute. 7. Ask others to help you. Consider incorporating the following ideas: - If your companion is a native speaker, take advantage of this great opportunity by asking questions frequently and seeking feedback. - Ask your companion and native speakers to correct you and to suggest ways to improve. If they use a word you don’t understand, ask them to define it for you. Children and grand- parents are often willing to help. - Invite those you teach to help you. Explain, “I’m learning your language. Please help me. If I struggle to find a word, please help me with it.” - Do not hesitate to ask for specific help: “How do you say ?” “How do you pronounce that?” Write down the answers and study them.', '<3-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching.

Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it. Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you. As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders. Your missionary call letter states: “You will also be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs. As you do these things the Lord will bless you and you will become an effective advocate and messenger of the truth. We place in you our confidence and pray that the Lord will help you meet your responsibilities in fulfilling this sacred assignment.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study Read Jacob 5:11–13, 61–64, 74–75, and answer these questions: - How does the Lord feel about His children? - What kind of effort does the Lord require of His servants? ##', '<4-hop>\n\nWork, work, work—there is no satisfactory substitute, especially in missionary work.” – PRESIDENT EZRA TAFT BENSON THE TEACHINGS OF EZRA TAFT BENSON (1988), 200 #### Scripture Study (Page 136) - What does it mean to be diligent? - Moroni 9:6 D&C 10:4, D&C 107:99–100 - Why does the Lord expect you to be diligent? - D&C 75:2–5, D&C 123:12–14, D&C 127:4 - How does diligence relate to agency? - Mosiah 4:26–27, D&C 58:26–29, Topical Guide, “Diligence, Diligent, Diligently” D&C 130:20–21 ## Obedience (Page 136) As a missionary, you are expected to keep the commandments willingly, to obey mission rules, and to follow the counsel of your leaders. Obedience is the first law of heaven. It is an act of faith. You may sometimes be required to do things you do not completely understand. As you obey, you increase in faith, knowledge, wisdom, testimony, protection, and freedom. Strive to be obedient to the Lord, the living prophet, and your mission president. “The discipline contained in daily obedience and clean living and wholesome lives builds an armor around you of protection and safety from the temptations that beset you as you proceed through mortality.” – ELDER L. TOM PERRY “CALLED TO SERVE,” ENSIGN, MAY 1991, 39 #### Scripture Study (Page 136) - What does it mean to be obedient? - 1 Nephi 2:3, Mosiah 5:8, Mosiah 15:7 - D&C 82:8–10, Matthew 7:24–27, John 7:17 - John 14:15, Topical Guide, “Obedience, Obedient, Obey” - What can you learn about obedience from these scriptures? - 1 Nephi 3:7, D&C 105:6, 2 Kings 5:1–14 - Why did the young warriors in Helaman’s army obey with exactness?

Follow the pattern found above to understand better and to plan for developing the attribute. Look at the image of the name tag. How does your name tag differ from that worn by an employee of a company? Note that the two most prominent parts are your name and the Savior’s name. How can you ensure that you represent the Savior as one of His disciples? Why is it important for people to associate your name with the Savior’s in a positive way? Write your thoughts in your study journal. #### Scripture Study (Page 137) - What are some attributes listed in the scriptures? - Mosiah 3:19, Alma 7:23, D&C 4, D&C 121:41–45, Articles of Faith 1:13, Philippians 4:8, 2 Peter 1:5–8 #### Remember This (Page 137) - You need to be a Christlike missionary, not just do missionary things. - Learning to be like Christ is a lifelong pursuit. - You follow Christ’s example—develop His attributes—one action and decision at a time. - Changing to become Christlike requires exercising faith, repenting, keeping covenants, receiving an increased measure of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ##', '<5-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 138) ### Personal Study (Page 138) - Prepare a five-minute talk on one of the attributes discussed in this chapter. - Using the Topical Guide, look for ways the Savior has exemplified the attributes described in this chapter. Record what you learn in your study journal. - Periodically complete the “Attribute Activity” at the end of this chapter. - Identify an attribute in this chapter. Ask yourself: - How can I develop this attribute? - What must change in my heart, mind, and actions to develop this attribute? - How will keeping covenants help me develop this attribute? - How will developing this attribute help me qualify for the Holy Spirit and become a more powerful minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - Find examples of Christlike attributes in the lives of men and women in the scriptures. Record your impressions in your study journal. ### Companion Study (Page 138) - Study references to Christlike attributes in the missionary library. - Discuss relationships among different attributes. For example: - How does faith relate to diligence? - In what ways are humility and love related? - How does knowledge strengthen patience? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 138) - Several days before district meeting or zone conference, ask each missionary to select one of the attributes in this chapter or in the scriptures and prepare a five- minute talk on that attribute, including scriptures that have helped him or her. Allow time in the meeting for a few missionaries to share their talks. - Divide the missionaries into three groups, and give them the following assignment: Group 1: Read 1 Nephi 17:7–16 and answer the following questions: - How did Nephi exercise his faith? - What did Nephi do that was Christlike? - What promises did the Lord make to Nephi if he would be faithful and keep the commandments? - How does this account apply to missionary work? Group 2: Read Jacob 7:1–15 and answer the following questions: - Why was Jacob’s faith strong enough to resist Sherem’s attack? - How did Jacob exercise faith when he talked with Sherem? - How were Jacob’s actions Christlike? - What can we do to develop faith like Jacob’s? Group 3: Read Joseph Smith—History 1:8–18, and answer the following questions: - In what ways did Joseph Smith exercise faith in Jesus Christ? - How was his faith tried? - What did he do that was Christlike? - What can we do to follow Joseph Smith’s example? After the groups finish, bring the missionaries together and ask them to share what they discussed. - Share an experience of when you were blessed or inspired by another person’s faith. - Have missionaries refer to the “Attribute Activity. - Page 140” Give each missionary a piece of paper on which to write his or her answers. - When they have completed the worksheet, invite them to set personal goals. - Ask a few of the missionaries to share what they learned and felt as they completed the worksheet. - Share your testimony concerning the importance of developing Christlike attributes. ### Mission President (Page 139) - Ask missionaries to read one of the four Gospels in the New Testament or 3 Nephi 11–28. Have them underline what the Savior did that they can also do. - Use goal setting and planning to teach missionaries about diligence. Show how diligence in focusing on people is an expression of love. - During interviews, ask missionaries to talk about an attribute they are trying to develop. - In a zone conference, invite missionaries to tell about Christlike attributes they admire in their companions. > Beginning of chapter 7 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual #', '<6-hop>\n\nHow Can I Better Learn My Mission Language? (Page 141) #### Consider This (Page 141) - Why must I continually improve my language abilities? - How can I improve my ability to speak and teach in my mission language? - How can I obtain the gift of tongues? ## Prepare Yourself Spiritually (Page 141) The Lord declared, “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power” (D&C 90:11). Strengthen your personal testimony to bring converting power to your words. First study the doctrines and the lessons in your native language. That understanding will strengthen your testimony and your capacity to teach and testify convincingly. You can then learn to express the message of the Restoration in your mission language under the guidance of the Spirit. Listed below are ways you can strengthen your faith that the Lord will help you teach and testify in your mission language: - Recognize that you have been called of God by a prophet. - Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. - Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards. - Pray sincerely for divine assistance. - Study, practice, and use the mission language each day. ## Be Dedicated and Diligent (Page 142) Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort. Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language takes time. Be patient with yourself.']","Missionaries can effectively incorporate a language study plan to enhance their missionary work and language skills by setting specific goals and selecting appropriate tools to aid their learning. They should focus on improving their ability to communicate and teach during scheduled activities, such as teaching appointments and ward council meetings. The plan should include memorizing vocabulary and phrases, learning grammar, and actively listening to native speakers. Additionally, missionaries are encouraged to practice pronunciation, read scriptures in their mission language, and seek help from companions and native speakers. By doing so, they can improve their language skills, which will help them better respond to the needs of investigators and the promptings of the Spirit, ultimately enhancing their effectiveness in missionary work."
How does the power of the Spirit influence missionary language learning and conversion according to the teachings in the provided context?,"['<1-hop>\n\n## The Power of the Spirit in Conversion (Page 106) The power of the Holy Ghost is central to conversion. Strive to understand the doctrine of conversion and also the experience of conversion. President Boyd K. Packer explained the central role of the Spirit in conversion: “When conversion takes place, it is through the power of the Spirit. In order to succeed in missionary work, these three things must occur: “We must understand what an investigator must feel in order to receive conversion. “We must understand how a missionary must feel in order to teach with the converting power of the Spirit. “And then we must understand how a member must feel to succeed in participating in the conversion experience” (mission presidents’ conference, 3 Apr. 1985). The better you understand how investigators, missionaries, and members feel when they receive the witness of the Spirit, the better you will understand your own role, which is to: - Be edified and have your mind enlightened as you search the scriptures and teach the doctrine. - Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear witness. You do this by teaching and testifying of the message of the Restoration. Teach as directed by the Spirit, and testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true. - Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting the message to each person’s needs. - Invite people to act. Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and make and keep covenants. Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke of the power of the Spirit: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed. When individuals . . . feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word. This is how we come to feel the gospel is true” (“Now Is the Time,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 75). The Holy Ghost works in the hearts of people to bring about these changes. As people choose to keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly and will develop the faith to obey Christ. Thus, you should help the people you work with grow in faith by inviting them to repent and to make and keep commitments. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 107) - Read one or two of the following passages, and ponder what an investigator must feel to be converted. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and members: 2 Nephi 4:16–35; Enos 1; Mosiah 4–5; 18:7–14; 27–28; Alma 5; 17–22; 32; 36; 38 - Read one or two of the following passages and ponder what you as a missionary and as a member must feel to teach with converting power. Record your feelings and impressions in your study journal. Discuss your ideas with other missionaries and members: 1 Nephi 8:11–12; Mosiah 28:1–4; Alma 26; 29; 31:26–38; 32; Moroni 7:43–48; D&C 4; 18:10–16; 50:21–22 ####', '<2-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 107) **What do these scriptures teach about the power of the Spirit in your work?** - 2 Nephi 33:1–2, D&C 42:11–17, D&C 50:13–22, Acts 2:37–38 - 1 Corinthians 2:11–14 Bible Dictionary, “Conversion” **What can you do to enjoy the power of the Spirit in your work?** - Alma 32:27–28, D&C 42:14, John 7:17 **Why is it important to teach what you know and believe?** - Alma 5:43–47, D&C 52:9, D&C 80:4 ##', '<3-hop>\n\nPray with Faith (Page 107) You can teach in the Lord’s way only by the power of the Spirit, and you receive the Spirit through the prayer of faith. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (D&C 42:14). As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” (2 Nephi 33:1). President Gordon B. Hinckley illustrated this principle by relating an experience from his mission: “I always remember two young men who served in my mission. One was a superstar. He was educated. He was bright. He was quick. He was a little arrogant. We had another who was a sign painter. He came from a sign shop with very little education, but he knew his inadequacies and he relied on the Lord. When he prayed, you knew he was talking with the Lord. It wasn’t a rote thing, it was a conversation and that young man accomplished wonders while the other young man went through the motions. The power that was in the one and the absence of power in the other was so apparent. Call upon the Lord. He has extended the invitation, and He will answer” (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 469). Strive to pray sincerely, with real intent, and with “all the energy of heart” (Moroni 7:48). Effective prayer requires great effort (see Moroni 10:3–4; D&C 8:10; 9:7). Give serious thought to your attitude and to the words you use. Consider the following when you pray: - Use the language of prayer, which shows that you love and respect your Heavenly Father. Use proper and respectful language in whatever language you speak. For example, in English use scriptural pronouns such as Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine. - Always express gratitude for your blessings. A conscious effort to be grateful will help you recognize how merciful the Lord has been in your life. - Pray specifically for the guidance and help of the Holy Ghost. Show that you value this blessing by being sensitive to and aware of spiritual promptings. Then courageously follow those promptings. - Pray with love and charity. Pray for people by name. Ask for inspiration to help you understand and meet their needs. Pray for the welfare of contacts, investigators, new converts, and less-active members. Pray for the members and priesthood and auxiliary leaders in your area. Pray for your family at home. Pray for your companion, other missionaries, and your mission president. Pray to know how you can help others, and then be willing to sacrifice in their behalf. - Pray that you will be shown where to go and what to do. Pray that you will be led to those who are prepared to receive the message of the Restoration. Pray that you will recognize them. - Recognize that your Heavenly Father knows what you need better than you do. Rely on the Spirit to know what to pray for (see 3 Nephi 19:24; D&C 46:28, 30). - In your prayers at night, give the Lord an accounting of your day’s activities. Then review with Him your plan for the next day. Listen for the promptings of the Spirit. - Pray to overcome temptation. Yielding to temptation interferes with the Spirit. - Pray and, when appropriate, fast for special blessings. - Pray about and ponder the scriptures. The scriptures open the window to revelation. - Believe that God will answer your prayers. Recognize that God’s thoughts are not your thoughts (see Isaiah 55:8–9), and trust God to answer your prayers in His own way and in His own time. “Every morning . . . , missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will be teaching. If they will do this, a new light will come into their lives. There will be greater enthusiasm for the work. They will come to know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking in His behalf. They will find a different response from those they teach. As they do so by the Spirit, their investigators will respond under the influence of the same Spirit.” – PRESIDENT GORDON B. HINCKLEY “MISSIONARY SERVICE,” FIRST WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP TRAINING MEETING, 11 JAN. 2003, 20', '<4-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching. Practice summarizing them in your own words. - Review the ideas in this chapter. Discuss which suggestions you could use in companion study during the next week. - If you are training a new missionary, take note of situations when your companion is not understood. Make a list of relevant words, phrases, or grammar that would help your companion. Explain and practice how to use what is on the list in upcoming, planned activities. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 148) - Invite native speakers to the meeting. Arrange for the missionaries to teach them in small groups. Ask the native speakers to take notes and give feedback on the missionaries’ language. - Assign one or two missionaries ahead of time to tell about successes they have had in studying the language. Have them share their ideas. - Assign an experienced missionary to present briefly some part of the language that is usually difficult for missionaries. Present examples of good usage, and have the missionaries practice them. - Have missionaries who are native to the culture share helpful insights. ### Mission President (Page 149) - Periodically interview missionaries in the language they are learning. - Ask local priesthood leaders for ideas on how missionaries can improve their language. - Identify the most common mistakes made by missionaries learning your mission language. Give instruction in zone conference on correcting these mistakes. - Teach missionaries the doctrine of spiritual gifts. - Observe your missionaries when they teach in the language. - Look for opportunities to use the language with your missionaries. > Beginning of chapter 7 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Use Time Wisely?

He wants you to watch over your area with love and great care. Your purpose is to help others come unto Him through baptism and confirmation. Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it. Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you. As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders. Your missionary call letter states: “You will also be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs. As you do these things the Lord will bless you and you will become an effective advocate and messenger of the truth. We place in you our confidence and pray that the Lord will help you meet your responsibilities in fulfilling this sacred assignment.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study Read Jacob 5:11–13, 61–64, 74–75, and answer these questions: - How does the Lord feel about His children? - What kind of effort does the Lord require of His servants? ##']","The power of the Spirit plays a crucial role in both missionary language learning and conversion. According to the context, true conversion occurs through the power of the Spirit, as it touches and changes hearts, leading individuals to feel the gospel is true. This spiritual influence is essential for missionaries to teach with converting power, as they must rely on the Spirit to adapt their message to each person's needs and invite them to act, thereby growing their faith. In terms of language learning, missionaries are encouraged to practice teaching in their mission language and receive feedback from native speakers, which is facilitated by the Spirit's guidance. The Spirit helps missionaries overcome language barriers by providing inspiration and enhancing their ability to communicate effectively, as illustrated by President Gordon B. Hinckley's experience of a missionary who, despite limited education, accomplished wonders through reliance on the Lord and the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit is integral to both the conversion process and the effective learning and use of missionary languages."
"How can the personal application of learning enhance missionary work, and what study methods are recommended to support this process?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nSee the Big Picture (Page 37) - Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background. - Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph. - Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain. - Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 37) Read the chapter summaries of the books below and write an outline that describes the setting, main events, and main doctrines of each book. - 1 Nephi - Moses - Acts ### Explore the Details (Page 38) - Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions. Examine surrounding words or phrases for clues to what the key words mean. - Look for connecting words, such as therefore, and again, thus, wherefore, and others. Then see how the preceding and following passages relate to each other. - Use the Topical Guide to see how the same word is used in other contexts or how other prophets use the same word. - Look for unfamiliar words or phrases and make sure you understand them. ### Marking Scriptures (Page 38) Marking your scriptures can assist you in thinking deeply about a passage or doctrine of the gospel. You can mark your scriptures in many ways. Find a method that works for you. Below are some guidelines for marking scriptures. - Use pencils or colored markers. Avoid using pens that bleed through the paper. - Shade, underline, bracket, or outline part of a verse, an entire verse, or a group of verses. - Avoid excessive marking. The benefit is lost if you cannot understand your markings because you have made too many notes, lines, and colors. - Underline only a few key words to highlight the verse, section, or chapter. - Circle or underline key words, and then use straight lines to link closely related words. - When a series of points in a verse or passage are related, number the points in the margin or text. - Use the footnotes as a resource for marking and interpreting the scriptures. - Place a symbol (such as a check mark) in the margin for key verses you feel are critical to remember. Marking your scriptures should help you focus on applying what you learn and on teaching others. Develop an approach that is consistent and helps you accomplish your purpose as a missionary. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 38) Which suggestions have you not yet tried? Identify one suggestion from “Study Ideas and Suggestions” to try during your next personal or companion study session. #### Remember This (Page 38) - Pursuing the desire to learn is important to your salvation and your success as a missionary. - You learn the gospel by study, faith, and the power of the Holy Ghost. - Learning is a joy and brings many blessings. - Daily personal and companion study strengthens your faith and your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Use a variety of study methods that make the experience meaningful and enjoyable. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 39) ### Personal Study (Page 39) 1. Rate yourself on the following (1=never, 3=some of the time, and 5=almost always). - I think about the people I am teaching when I study. - Throughout the day I think about what I studied in the morning. - As I study, ideas come to my mind that have not occurred to me before. - I record spiritual impressions and ideas in an appropriate place. - I fall asleep as I study. - I look forward to personal study. - I look forward to companion study. Review your responses. What are you doing well? Do you wish any of your responses were different? Set one or two goals that will improve the quality of your study. 2. Review the “Consider This” questions at the beginning of this chapter. How do these questions influence your study? 3. Review the “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Identify one suggestion from each category that you have not used, and try these ideas during your personal study. 4. Read Doctrine and Covenants 138:1–11. As you read these verses, answer the following questions: – What did President Smith have to do for his mind to be opened? – How did he feel about the doctrine he was thinking about? 5. Read the definition of knowledge in the Bible Dictionary and the references listed. In your study journal, write an answer to the question “What knowledge can help me serve effectively as a missionary?” 6. Select a doctrine from chapter 3 you would like to understand better. Write in your study journal questions you would like to answer. Carefully study that doctrine for a period of time (a few days), and pray specifically for increased understanding. Write what you learn. 7. Read 1 Nephi 10:17; 11:1–6. As you read these verses, answer the question “Why was Nephi able to learn what his father knew?”', '<3-hop>\n\nChildren and grand- parents are often willing to help. - Invite those you teach to help you. Explain, “I’m learning your language. Please help me. If I struggle to find a word, please help me with it.” - Do not hesitate to ask for specific help: “How do you say ?” “How do you pronounce that?” Write down the answers and study them. ?” “What does mean?” “Would you please repeat - Ask members to quiz you on your note cards or vocabulary lists and to help you in reading scriptures aloud. 8. Evaluate and revise your study plan. Review your study plan each week to evaluate if it is working. Invite your companion and mission leaders to suggest areas for improvement. Use your mission language at every opportunity. Speak the language with your companion as much as possible throughout the day. Pray in the language privately and publicly to learn the appropriate language for prayer and to learn to speak what is in your heart. Do not be afraid of making mistakes. Everyone who learns a new language makes mistakes. People will understand, and they will appreciate your efforts to learn their language. Memorizing phrases and scriptures will help you avoid mistakes, but you should not use lengthy memorized or prepared scripts as a way to avoid mistakes. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 145) Using the guidelines described above, create a study plan. Review your plan with your companion or a mission leader. ## Learn with Your Companions (Page 145) Help your companions experience success and gain confidence in learning the language as rapidly as possible. Sincerely and frequently compliment your companions and other missionaries on their progress. Be sensitive not to say or do anything that might weaken their confidence, but don’t protect them so much that they do not learn. Do not withhold help when it is needed. Give them many opportunities to teach and testify successfully. Consider the following ideas for learning with your companions: - Teach each other the grammar and vocabulary you have learned. - Practice teaching in the mission language. At first, new missionaries might teach very simply, share a simple testimony, and recite memorized scriptures. As their confidence and ability increase, they will be able to participate more fully in teaching investigators. - Practice using the language to communicate in common missionary situations. - Give each other simple and practical feedback with kindness. It is also important that you receive feedback without taking offense. Note how a more experienced missionary helped his companion in the following true account: I had just arrived in my second area when my companion told me it was my turn to give the spiritual thought at a dinner appointment. I was more than just a little scared. My first companion had always been happy to do the teaching, and I was used to giving my small portion of the lesson and then listening as he would then expound and answer any questions. I tried to convince my companion that he should give the spiritual thought, but he encouraged me to take the assignment. I practiced with his help. When the moment arrived, I opened my scriptures and read from 3 Nephi 5 and 7. I struggled but managed to explain why I felt my chosen passages were significant, and I was relieved when I was done. When a question was asked, I looked to my companion to answer, but he didn’t open his mouth. That was when I amazed myself by coming up with an answer in understandable French. I was even more amazed that the member didn’t seem to sense that I was insecure about my communication skills. I gained confidence and realized that my French was better than I gave myself credit for. The weeks passed, and my companion continued to let me teach—even when I didn’t think I could do it, even when he probably wondered if I could do it. And because he encouraged me to speak, listen, and teach, my language skills began to progress more quickly, and I felt that I had become a tool of our Father in Heaven instead of being simply another elder’s quiet companion. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 146) - If you are working with a new missionary, how can you better help your companion learn the language? - If you are a new missionary, what kind of help might you ask from your senior companion? ##', '<4-hop>\n\nCulture and Language Learning (Page 146) Culture and language are closely related. Understanding the culture will help explain why language is used the way it is. Strive to understand the culture of the people so that you can communicate the unique aspects of the message of the Restoration in a way that will be clear to them. One of the greatest things you can do to gain people’s trust and love is to embrace their culture in appropriate ways. Many great missionaries have done so (see 1 Corinthians 9:20–23). Seek to have the people feel comfortable with you and your language. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 147) - Imagine that you are serving a mission in Asia. You are preparing to teach someone about resurrection, and you know that Buddhists believe in reincarnation. How will you teach about resurrection in such a way that the investigator will understand that this doctrine is distinctly different from reincarnation? What words and phrases might you need to learn to accomplish this task? - Think about the cultural and religious background of the people you teach. Identify an aspect of their background that might lead them to misunderstand the doctrines of the gospel. Plan ways to teach these doctrines clearly. ## The Gift of Tongue (Page 147) Seek the gifts of the Spirit, including the gift of tongues and the interpretation of tongues. More than anything else, this will help you speak and understand the language of the people in your mission. You will not obtain this gift without effort on your part; you need to actively seek it. Part of seeking the gift of tongues is to labor and struggle and to do all you can to learn the language. Trust that the Spirit will help you as you live the way you should and do your very best. Have faith that you can have the gift of tongues in its true and most comprehensive sense. When you feel you are struggling to express yourself as clearly as you would like, remember that the Spirit is able to speak to the hearts of all of God’s children. President Thomas S. Monson taught: “There is one language . . . that is common to each missionary—the language of the Spirit. It is not learned from textbooks written by men of letters, nor is it acquired through reading and memorization. The language of the Spirit comes to him who seeks with all his heart to know God and keep His divine commandments. Proficiency in this language permits one to breach barriers, overcome obstacles, and touch the human heart” (“The Spirit Giveth Life,” Ensign, June 1997, 2). #### Remember This (Page 147) - Study the doctrines and lessons you teach in your native language first. - Learn to express these doctrines and your feelings about them in your mission language. - Create a language study plan and regularly try new ideas as you seek to improve in your mission language. - Seek the guidance of the Spirit to help you understand and communicate with the people of your mission. ##', '<5-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 148) ### Personal Study (Page 148) - Review the suggestions in this chapter. Identify a suggestion you have not yet tried, and set a goal to try it for the next few days. - At your next district meeting, ask an experienced missionary with good language ability what he or she has done to learn the language. - Read and discuss the following statement by Elder Richard G. Scott: “Where . . . national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God, set them aside. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished” (“Removing Barriers to Happiness,” Ensign, May 1998, 87). Think about the ways that the culture in the area where you serve is different from your own. Make a list of the differences. Then cross out any that conflict with the teachings of the gospel. Consider each of those that remain, and think about how you can make these customs your own. - Build a study plan to prepare you to do one of the following things in your mission language: - Tell the Joseph Smith story. - Summarize 3 Nephi 11. - Summarize Alma 32. - Tell the story of Nephi and the brass plates (see 1 Nephi 3–5). - Explain dispensations. - Share a personal experience. - Make note cards for words you don’t know in one of the lessons. Carry them with you until you have learned them all.']","The personal application of learning can significantly enhance missionary work by encouraging individuals to internalize gospel principles and set personal goals for spiritual growth. This process involves 'likening' scriptures to oneself, setting goals to live what is learned, and evaluating how well one lives the principles taught. Recommended study methods to support this process include being alert and organized during study sessions, studying by topic, visualizing scripture stories, and sharing insights with others. Additionally, using study resources such as the LDS edition of the scriptures, missionary lessons, and Church magazines can deepen understanding. Marking scriptures and using a study journal to record and organize learning are also suggested to facilitate personal application and improve teaching effectiveness."
"How can missionaries effectively incorporate a language study plan to enhance their language learning and teaching abilities, and what role does language learning play in their spiritual growth?","['<1-hop>\n\n- Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. - Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards. - Pray sincerely for divine assistance. - Study, practice, and use the mission language each day. ## Be Dedicated and Diligent (Page 142) Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort. Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language takes time. Be patient with yourself. Seek the help of your companion, members, investigators, and other missionaries. Do not stop improving your language skills once people begin to understand you. As your ability to speak the language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it. You will be less worried about how to communicate the feelings that are in your heart. You will be better able to respond to the needs of investigators and the promptings of the Spirit. Strive to master the language throughout your mission and after you return. The Lord has invested much in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your life. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained: “We would . . . hope that every missionary learning a new proselyting language would master it in every way possible. . . . And as you do so, your proselyting and testifying skills will improve. You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive to your investigators. . . . Don’t be satisfied with what we call a missionary vocabulary only. Stretch yourself in the language, and you will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (missionary satellite broadcast, Aug. 1998). You are not alone in learning your mission language. Whenever the Lord gives a commandment, He provides a way to accomplish it (see 1 Nephi 3:7). Seek His help. Be dedicated in your study. In time you will acquire the language skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. ## Learn English (Page 142) If you do not speak English, you should study it as a missionary. This will bless you during your mission and throughout your life. Learning English will enable you to help build the Lord’s kingdom in additional ways and will be a blessing for you and your family. Many of the suggestions found in this chapter will help you. Focus particularly on the following: - Set a goal to speak English with your companion. If your companion already knows English and is trying to learn your language, you might choose to speak English in the apartment and the mission language when you go out. - With your companion, read from the Book of Mormon in English. You might also choose to alternate: You read a verse in English, and then your companion reads a verse in the mission language. Correct each other’s pronunciation and intonation. - Ask your mission president for suggestions on a simple English grammar text if you do not already have one. ## Principles of Language Learning (Page 142) This section describes principles to help you study and learn the language more effectively. - **Take responsibility.** Regularly create or adjust your language learning goals and study plan. Strive to use the language at every opportunity. - **Make your study meaningful.** Ask yourself: Why am I studying this? How will it help me communicate better? Relate what you study to real-life situations and daily activities. Study parts of the language that will help you say what you want to say. For example, if there is a scripture story you would like to include in your teaching, learn the vocabulary and grammar necessary to relate it. - Seek to communicate. Seek to find an appropriate balance between studying grammar and the structure of the language and learning through your daily activities. There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language. - Learn new concepts thoroughly. You will be able to recall and effectively use language principles if you review regularly what you have studied and if you practice again in new situations. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nCreate a Language Study Plan (Page 143) A language study plan helps both new and experienced missionaries focus on what they can do each day to improve their ability to speak the mission language. Your plan will include what you will do during your language study time and what you will do throughout the day. As needed, use some of your language study time to create or adjust your study plan. Then each morning during your language study time, learn the language needed for the day’s activities. The following guidelines will help you in creating your own language learning plan: 1. Set goals. Weekly and daily goals will help you learn your mission language. Focus your goals on improving your ability to communicate and teach during scheduled activities, such as teaching appointments, finding opportunities, and ward council meetings. Review your progress in achieving your language goals. Ask yourself what you can do to communicate with greater clarity and power during your scheduled activities. 2. Select which tools to use. Review the following language tools and determine which you can use to achieve your goals: - The standard works in your mission language. - The lessons in your mission language. - A pocket-size dictionary. - A small grammar book. - MTC language materials. - Note cards. - A pocket notebook. - Other Church materials in your mission language. 3. Memorize vocabulary and phrases. Identify vocabulary and phrases that will help you accomplish your goals. Your language plan might include the following ideas: - Identify vocabulary and phrases in the lessons, brochures, scriptures, and other Church publications that you can use in teaching. - Record words or phrases you do not know in a notebook. Carry a small dictionary and look up these words. - Carry note cards to study throughout the day. Write a word or phrase on one side and the definition on the opposite side. Set aside the words you learn. Work on the remaining words until you know them all. - Use new words and phrases in sentences during personal study, teaching, and throughout the day. - Practice pronunciation by saying new words and phrases out loud. - Memorize key scriptures in the mission language. - Memorize simple statements from the lessons or brochures that convey key gospel principles. Find other ways to express these ideas. 4. Learn grammar. Use your language tools to identify grammar principles that will help you achieve your goals. If needed, ask your companion, an experienced missionary, or a member for help. Consider incorporating some of the following ideas: - Use the grammar text you received at the MTC or a text approved by your mission president to help you understand the grammar and sentence patterns found in the lessons, brochures, and scriptures. - Prepare sentences to use in your scheduled activities that apply these grammar principles. Practice speaking and writing the sentences. - Pay attention to word order in the language and to words and their parts. - Look for opportunities to practice and apply the grammar that you study each day. 5. Actively listen. Consider incorporating the following: - Listen carefully to native speakers. Imitate what you hear. - When you hear something you do not understand, write it down and find out what it means. Practice using the vocabulary or sentence pattern. - When listening, identify vocabulary and patterns that you have recently learned. - When you hear a phrase expressed differently from the way you would say it, write it down and practice it. However, as a servant of the Lord, always use appropriate language, not slang. - Make a list of things people might say to you during your planned activities. Look up words and phrases related to these responses. Plan and practice ways that you could respond. 6. Improve your ability to read and write. Read the Book of Mormon in your mission language to learn vocabulary and phrases and to practice grammar, pronunciation, and fluency. There is great power in using the scriptures in your language study. Also consider the following ideas: - Learn to read and write the alphabet, script, or characters of your language. For character-based writing systems, focus on reading skills, such as scripture reading, that will help you when you teach. - Read out loud from the Book of Mormon, other scriptures, or Church magazines in your mission language. Pay attention to unfamiliar vocabulary, phrases, and grammar. If you do not understand a word, try to understand its meaning from the context of the passage before you look it up. Add the word to your note cards. Use your native- language and mission-language scriptures side-by-side if necessary. - Have someone coach you on pronunciation, intonation, and pauses as you read. - Practice writing in your mission language—for example, personal notes and reminders, letters, thank-you notes, and notes of encouragement. Write your testimony in copies of the Book of Mormon that you distribute. 7. Ask others to help you. Consider incorporating the following ideas: - If your companion is a native speaker, take advantage of this great opportunity by asking questions frequently and seeking feedback. - Ask your companion and native speakers to correct you and to suggest ways to improve. If they use a word you don’t understand, ask them to define it for you. Children and grand- parents are often willing to help. - Invite those you teach to help you. Explain, “I’m learning your language. Please help me. If I struggle to find a word, please help me with it.” - Do not hesitate to ask for specific help: “How do you say ?” “How do you pronounce that?” Write down the answers and study them.', '<3-hop>\n\nHow Can I Better Learn My Mission Language? (Page 141) #### Consider This (Page 141) - Why must I continually improve my language abilities? - How can I improve my ability to speak and teach in my mission language? - How can I obtain the gift of tongues? ## Prepare Yourself Spiritually (Page 141) The Lord declared, “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power” (D&C 90:11). Strengthen your personal testimony to bring converting power to your words. First study the doctrines and the lessons in your native language. That understanding will strengthen your testimony and your capacity to teach and testify convincingly. You can then learn to express the message of the Restoration in your mission language under the guidance of the Spirit. Listed below are ways you can strengthen your faith that the Lord will help you teach and testify in your mission language: - Recognize that you have been called of God by a prophet. - Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. - Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards. - Pray sincerely for divine assistance. - Study, practice, and use the mission language each day. ## Be Dedicated and Diligent (Page 142) Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort. Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language takes time. Be patient with yourself.']","Missionaries can effectively incorporate a language study plan by setting weekly and daily goals focused on improving their ability to communicate and teach during scheduled activities, such as teaching appointments and ward council meetings. They should select appropriate language tools, such as the standard works in their mission language, a pocket-size dictionary, and MTC language materials, to achieve their goals. Memorizing vocabulary and phrases, learning grammar, actively listening to native speakers, and improving reading and writing skills are essential components of the study plan. Additionally, missionaries are encouraged to seek help from companions and native speakers to correct and improve their language skills. Language learning plays a crucial role in spiritual growth by enabling missionaries to teach and testify more effectively in their mission language, thereby fulfilling their purpose as servants of the Lord. By living worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost, being obedient, and praying for divine assistance, missionaries can strengthen their personal testimony and bring converting power to their words, ultimately enhancing their spiritual insights and gospel application."
"How can missionary language learning practices, such as companion study and district meetings, contribute to the key indicators for conversion, including baptism and confirmation?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching.

He wants you to watch over your area with love and great care. Your purpose is to help others come unto Him through baptism and confirmation. Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it. Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you. As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders. Your missionary call letter states: “You will also be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs. As you do these things the Lord will bless you and you will become an effective advocate and messenger of the truth. We place in you our confidence and pray that the Lord will help you meet your responsibilities in fulfilling this sacred assignment.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study Read Jacob 5:11–13, 61–64, 74–75, and answer these questions: - How does the Lord feel about His children? - What kind of effort does the Lord require of His servants? ##', '<2-hop>\n\nKey Indicators for Conversion (Page 152) Perhaps you have wondered which of your many duties are the most important. To be able to answer this question, you must understand your purpose and know how effective use of time can help you fulfill this purpose. Your purpose is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Key indicators have been identified by Church leaders to help you focus on this purpose. As you focus on these indicators, you will help people progress toward baptism, confirmation, continued activity in the Church, and lasting conversion. #### Key Indicators to Record and Report (Page 152) - Investigators baptized and confirmed - Investigators with a baptismal date - Investigators who attend sacrament meeting - Lessons taught to investigators with a member present - Other lessons taught - Progressing investigators - Referrals received and contacted - New investigators - Lessons taught to recent converts and less-active members These indicators identify events and conditions that show a person’s progress toward enduring conversion. A brief description of each key indicator is given below: - Investigators baptized and confirmed: Each person who has received the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. Report baptisms for the week in which they take place and confirmations for the week in which they take place. - Investigators with a baptismal date: Each investigator who has agreed to be baptized and confirmed on specific dates. - Investigators who attend sacrament meeting: Each investigator who has attended sacrament meeting. - Lessons taught to investigators with a member present: The total number of lessons taught to all investigators with a member present. A lesson typically includes the teaching of one or more gospel principles from the lessons, an opening and closing prayer, and invitations to make commitments. It is not necessary to teach all the principles of a lesson to consider it a complete lesson. The effectiveness of your teaching can be measured by whether investigators are growing in their faith in the Savior, repenting of their transgressions, and earnestly preparing to receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. Report only those lessons at which you were present. Report the total number of lessons taught, not the number of investigators who received lessons. - Other lessons taught: The total number of lessons taught to investigators without a member present. - Progressing investigators: The total number of investigators who have been taught two or more lessons and are keeping commitments such as to pray, read from the Book of Mormon, attend church, and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Investigators who are willing to continue learning about the gospel but are struggling to keep commitments are not progressing investigators as defined here. They are classified either as new investigators or other investigators. - Referrals received and contacted: The total number of referrals you have contacted and either taught or asked for a specific return appointment. Once you contact a referral, the referral is moved from the referral pool and either becomes a new investigator, is marked for further follow-up, or is dropped. A referral is also considered contacted if after many attempts you cannot reach the person or you find that the address is incorrect. These referrals are sent back to the mission office with a note describing why contact could not be made. Total referrals received refers to all the referrals you received that have not yet been contacted (referrals from members, investigators, Church headquarters, and so forth). For reporting purposes, the number of referrals that have not yet been contacted carries over from week to week. Each new referral is added to this number and each referral contacted is subtracted from it. Remember, however, that “referrals contacted” refers to the number contacted in the week being reported. - New investigators: The total number of individuals who have received a lesson and accepted a specific return appointment. Lessons taught to recent converts and less-active members: The total number of lessons taught to converts who have been members for less than one year and to less-active members. As you set goals and make plans, evaluate what you do in terms of how your efforts will add to the numbers of people represented in each of these key indicators. Your goal should be to have increasing numbers for every key indicator. You will do many things that are not described in the key indicators, such as street contacting or personal and companion study. These important activities contribute to one or more of the key indicators. For example, when you teach those you find through your own efforts, you add new investigators to your teaching pool. Also, the quality of your personal and companion study will improve your ability to teach by the Spirit, which will bless your new and progressing investigators. The power of your finding and teaching will influence every key indicator. Evaluate all you do based on whether it adds to the numbers of people in these categories. If you and your companion cannot see how a proselyting activity might help increase the numbers of people in one or more key indicators, you need to question whether the activity is worth your time. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 153) In your study journal, list every proselyting activity you have done in the past three days. For each activity, determine if it influenced one of the key indicators. If it did, write yes beside it. If it did not, write no. For each activity with a yes, describe how it had an impact. For each activity with a no, decide why you did it and whether you will continue to do the activity in the future. Discuss your list with your companion, and explain why you marked some activities yes and some activities no. Discuss which activities you may need to stop doing. ## The Area Book and Planning and Reporting']","Missionary language learning practices, such as companion study and district meetings, play a crucial role in contributing to the key indicators for conversion. During companion study, missionaries practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in their mission language, which helps improve their pronunciation and ability to summarize scripture stories or passages in their own words. This practice enhances their teaching effectiveness, which is essential for helping investigators grow in their faith and prepare for baptism and confirmation. District meetings and zone conferences further support language learning by involving native speakers who provide feedback, and by having experienced missionaries present difficult language aspects. These activities ensure that missionaries can effectively communicate the gospel, thereby increasing the likelihood of investigators attending sacrament meetings, progressing in their commitments, and ultimately receiving the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. By improving language skills, missionaries can better engage with investigators, leading to more meaningful lessons and a greater impact on the key indicators for conversion."
"How can missionaries effectively teach the restored gospel and support new converts in maintaining their commitment, particularly through the use of scriptures and understanding the significance of baptism?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 236) - During ward council meeting, ask the bishop if there are any less-active members in your area he would like you to visit this week. As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ###', '<2-hop>\n\nUse the Scriptures (Page 194) The standard works of the Church are your basic sources for teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. You may also use the words of living prophets. There are many reasons why it is vital to use the scriptures as the basis for your teaching. For example: - The Lord and His prophets have instructed us to do so (see D&C 42:12, 56–58; 71:1). A latter-day prophet counseled, “The words and the way they are used in the Book of Mormon by the Lord . . . should be used by us in teaching gospel principles” (Ezra Taft Benson, “The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants,” Ensign, May 1987, 84). - The scriptures invite the Holy Ghost into your teaching. They teach God’s word with power (see Alma 31:5). - The scriptures answer the great questions of the soul (see 2 Nephi 32:3; Jacob 2:8). - The scriptures give authority and validity to your teaching, even in areas without a Christian background. Your ability to teach with power from the scriptures comes in large measure from the time you personally spend studying them. As you daily feast upon the word, your ability to teach from the scriptures will improve. In addition, your invitations to study and ponder the scriptures will be more powerful because you are doing the same thing in your life. Help people gain faith in the scriptures— particularly the Book of Mormon—as sources of revealed truth. When people come to believe the scriptures, you will be better able to help them understand doctrines correctly. The following suggestions may help. 1. Introduce the scripture. Describe briefly the background and context of the passage you will use. Invite the investigator to look for particular points in the passage. When teaching people with a limited knowledge of the scriptures, you may need to begin by describing the contents of a passage, using language that they will understand. Below are examples of introducing a scripture: - “Here in Joseph Smith’s history we have Joseph’s own words telling what happened to him as he went into the grove to pray. He said, ‘I saw a pillar of light . . .’ ” - “In this passage the prophet Alma is teaching people who are poor to exercise their faith in the word of God. He compares the word of God to a seed that can be planted in our hearts. Will you begin reading verse . . .” 2. Read the passage. Read the verses aloud or ask the investigator to read aloud. Be sensitive to those who struggle to read. If a passage is difficult for them to understand, read with them carefully and help them understand the more difficult points. Or give them a simpler passage to read. You might also define difficult words or phrases: - “Let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not [‘upbraideth not’ means that God won’t find blame or fault] and it shall be given him” (James 1:5). Some scriptural passages are clear and need no explanation. For others you may take time to explain what has been read. 3. Apply the scripture. “Liken” the scriptures to yourself and to investigators by showing how the principles are relevant today (see 1 Nephi 19:23). Show investigators how they can apply the principles in their lives. As they do, they will come to know that the doctrine is true. Bear your testimony of the principle, and promise them blessings. For example: - “The people of Alma, like you, had heavy burdens placed on them, almost more than they could bear. But as they exercised faith and ‘cried mightily to God,’ He strengthened them so they could endure the challenges and then delivered them from their trials. Just as He did with these people, I know God will help you in your trials as you . . .” - “Alma’s instruction to the people at the waters of Mormon applies to us today. John, are you willing to . . .” The people you teach will differ widely in how they view sacred texts, how familiar they are with the Bible, how well they understand scriptural language, and how deeply they believe that the Bible contains God’s word. Help all investigators gain an appreciation for the scriptures. By effectively using the scriptures in your teaching, you can help investigators begin to study the scriptures on their own. After each visit, suggest specific chapters or verses for them to read. You might give them questions to consider as they read, which you can discuss in your next meeting. This will encourage them to study the scriptures daily in their homes and participate in Church meetings and classes where the scriptures are used.']","Missionaries can effectively teach the restored gospel by using the scriptures as their basic source, as instructed by the Lord and His prophets. The scriptures invite the Holy Ghost into teaching, provide authority, and answer the great questions of the soul. By daily studying the scriptures, missionaries improve their ability to teach with power and help others gain faith in the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon. This approach is crucial for helping new converts understand doctrines correctly and maintain their commitment. Additionally, understanding the significance of baptism, as described by President Joseph F. Smith, can help new converts regain the 'desire and purpose' they once had. President Smith described his baptism as a moment of pure peace, love, and light, which cleansed him from sin and filled him with a desire to do good. Missionaries can support new converts by helping them remember these feelings and encouraging them to seek forgiveness and maintain their commitment to the gospel, even when they face challenges."

Are they guided by the Holy Ghost? Have you received answers to your prayers? When you pray as companions, do you: – Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness? – Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers? – Pray for people by name and consider their needs? – Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you? – Receive answers to your prayers? - Discuss as companions how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly. - Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost. Write comments that investigators have made about their experiences with the Spirit in learning the gospel and trying to keep commitments. How can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 116) - Occasionally ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you. - In interviews, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers. Ask them if they feel their prayers are meaningful. - Ask missionaries how they help investigators feel and recognize the Spirit. - As appropriate, relate to missionaries how you receive revelation on transfers, missionaries who are disobedient or need help, and doctrines to teach. > Beginning of Chapter 5 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon? (Page 117) #### Consider This - How is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion? - How does the Book of Mormon answer the great questions of the soul? - Why is the Book of Mormon so powerful in the conversion process? - How should I use the Book of Mormon to build faith and help others to draw closer to God? - Why is the promise in Moroni 10:3–5 central in missionary work? ## Overview (Page 117) The Book of Mormon is powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching. ##', '<3-hop>\n\n| Information Pyramid | Tools: | | --- | --- | | Mission President | Missionary Weekly Report | | Mission Leaders | Call-In Summary Report | | Ward Council | Progress Record | | Missionaries | Missionary Daily Planner; Area Book | These tools and all the information needed to do your work are kept in the area book and the Missionary Daily Planner.

Through goals and plans, our hopes are transformed into action. Goal setting and planning are acts of faith. Prayerfully set goals that are in harmony with the Savior’s command to “teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Matthew 28:19). Set goals for each key indicator. You may also set goals for your personal development. Do everything within your power to achieve your goals while respecting the agency of others. The ultimate measure of success is not in achieving goals alone but in the service you render and the progress of others. Goals are a means of helping you bring about much good among Heavenly Father’s children. They are not to be used to receive recognition. Carefully considered goals will give you clear direction and will help you fill your days with activities that help people strengthen their faith in the Savior and progress toward baptism, confirmation, and full activity in the Church. Challenging goals will help you work effectively and lead you to stretch and grow. Follow the guidelines below as you set goals: - Follow the Spirit. - Focus on the key indicators. - Focus on people. Although you will use numbers, be able to support your numbers with the names of people where possible. - Be specific and realistic, but set goals that will make you stretch.', '<5-hop>\n\nSet goals and make plans for lessons you will teach. Determine how you will help these people attend sacrament meeting and keep other commitments. 10. Set goals and make plans to find new investigators. Review the previous week’s efforts to find new investigators through referrals, service opportunities, and personal finding activities. Refer to the information in the “Potential Investigators” section of your area book. Discuss why some people became new investigators and others did not. Set goals for how many new investigators you will find this week. Identify people who are likely to become investigators. Also identify members and part-member families you want to visit, referrals to visit, and service opportunities you will seek. Plan which finding tools you will use, such as pass-along cards, videocassettes, DVDs, scriptures, or brochures. Also discuss where you will go to contact people, how many people you will contact each day, investigators you will ask for referrals, former investigators you will visit, ways the ward council can help, and so on. Make specific plans for the next day. Fill in all remaining time with finding activities that will help you achieve your goals. Set goals and plan to talk to as many people as the Lord puts in your path. Always strive to find people to teach. 11. Plan how to work with the ward council. The bishop is the presiding authority. Respect and honor his authority. Under his direction, review the Progress Record used in the previous missionary coordination meeting or ward council. Discuss assignments you have received from the bishop or ward mission leader, and report on whether you have completed them. Discuss how to involve others who can help, such as the ward mission leader, priesthood and auxiliary leaders, and other members. Carefully prepare a Progress Record for the upcoming ward council meeting, priesthood executive committee meeting, or missionary coordination meeting. Make sure it is neatly written and clean. Set goals and make plans to work in harmony with the ward leaders. When possible, make copies of the Progress Record for the ward leaders who will attend. 12. Schedule meetings that occur regularly. In your Missionary Daily Planner, schedule meetings that happen regularly, such as district meetings, zone conferences, interviews, and Church meetings. Discuss assignments you need to complete prior to any of these meetings, and add them to your Notes/To Do List. 13. Conduct companionship inventory. At the end of your weekly planning session, share with your companion appropriate goals, and ask for his or her help to accomplish them. Discuss the strength of your relationship with your companion. Discuss any challenges that may be keeping your companionship from working in unity or from being obedient. Resolve conflicts. Share with your companion what you think his or her strengths are. Ask for suggestions on how you can improve. If needed, set goals that will improve your relationship. Conclude with prayer. ##', '<6-hop>\n\nDaily Planning Session (Page 164) Conduct a planning session at the end of each day. If you are teaching a lesson, you may be out until 9:30 p.m. Otherwise, return to your apartment by 9:00 p.m. and hold a daily planning session from 9:00 to 9:30 p.m. (Mission presidents have discretion to adjust the schedule according to local circumstances.) Apply the same principles and guidelines in a daily planning session that you follow in a weekly session but in a simpler way. Be prayerful as you discuss the lessons or topics you can study during personal and companion study time that will help you with your plan. Write these topics in the space provided on the daily schedule. Review your daily schedule. Have a meaningful activity planned for every hour of the day. During the Sunday-night planning session, total and submit your weekly Call-In Summary Report, write your weekly letter to your mission president, and finalize your goals for the coming week. Prior to leaving your apartment the next day, review your goals, plans, and schedule. Make revisions if needed. Always pray before leaving your apartment. You can tell how effective your daily plans are when you don’t need to ask others, “Now what should I do?” ## Accountability (Page 164) The principle of accountability is fundamental in God’s eternal plan. We will all stand before the Lord at the last judgment and give an accounting for what we have done with the opportunities He has given us (see Alma 5:15–19; D&C 137:9). There is much you can learn about accountability on your mission that will benefit you throughout your life. The principle of accountability will bless you if you: - Approach your goal setting and planning with the idea that you will account for your efforts to your mission leaders and to the Lord through prayer. - Feel personal responsibility for the sacred trust the Lord has given you. - Set meaningful goals. - Choose to be proactive in accounting for your work to the Lord and to your mission leaders. Don’t wait to be asked. Don’t require others to follow up with you frequently. Have a desire to account for your labor. - Accept full responsibility for your efforts. Never blame others for difficult circumstances or lack of progress. - Seek to learn from your leaders, and invite them to suggest ways you can improve. - Be motivated to do your best work. Accountability does not come only at the end of your mission. It is a principle that influences how you begin, how you think and feel about the responsibility the Lord has given you, how you approach your work, and how well you endure. The attitude you have toward your mission experience is a reflection of your love toward your Heavenly Father and His Son and your respect for the priesthood. As you pray personally and in your companionship, seek inspiration on what you should do each day. As you follow your plans, pray and ask the Lord for guidance. Have a prayer in your heart throughout the day that the Spirit will help you know where to go, what to do, and what to say. Ask yourself, “What more can I do?” In your prayer at the end of the day, give an accounting of your work. You will give an accounting each week to your mission leaders using the Call-In Summary Report. If you are a mission leader, you will receive this information from other missionaries. Show an interest in their lives and in the lives of those they teach rather than simply in numbers. Do not use these tools or the information you receive as ways to control or manipulate. The information you receive through these tools will provide you with opportunities to praise missionaries for their dedication and to see opportunities for future training. “When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.” – PRESIDENT THOMAS S. MONSON JUNE 2004 WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP TRAINING BROADCAST']","Faith and goal setting are integral to missionary work as outlined in the Preach My Gospel manual. Faith is cultivated through sincere prayer, as missionaries are encouraged to pray for guidance and to act on the answers they receive, believing that God will provide what is asked for in righteousness. This faith is further strengthened by the Book of Mormon, which serves as a powerful tool in conversion, providing evidence of Christ's divinity and the Restoration. Missionaries are taught to set goals that reflect their desires and vision, transforming hopes into action. These goals should be in harmony with the Savior’s command to teach and baptize, focusing on key indicators and personal development. By setting specific, realistic, and challenging goals, missionaries can effectively work towards helping others strengthen their faith and progress towards baptism and full activity in the Church. The process of setting and achieving goals is seen as an act of faith, where missionaries are encouraged to follow the Spirit and focus on people, using numbers to support their progress. This approach not only aids in personal spiritual growth but also enhances the conversion process for those they teach."

Identify a suggestion you have not yet tried, and set a goal to try it for the next few days. - At your next district meeting, ask an experienced missionary with good language ability what he or she has done to learn the language. - Read and discuss the following statement by Elder Richard G. Scott: “Where . . . national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God, set them aside. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished” (“Removing Barriers to Happiness,” Ensign, May 1998, 87). Think about the ways that the culture in the area where you serve is different from your own. Make a list of the differences. Then cross out any that conflict with the teachings of the gospel. Consider each of those that remain, and think about how you can make these customs your own. - Build a study plan to prepare you to do one of the following things in your mission language: - Tell the Joseph Smith story. - Summarize 3 Nephi 11. - Summarize Alma 32. - Tell the story of Nephi and the brass plates (see 1 Nephi 3–5). - Explain dispensations. - Share a personal experience. - Make note cards for words you don’t know in one of the lessons.

Record what you learn in your study journal. - Periodically complete the “Attribute Activity” at the end of this chapter. - Identify an attribute in this chapter. Ask yourself: - How can I develop this attribute? - What must change in my heart, mind, and actions to develop this attribute? - How will keeping covenants help me develop this attribute? - How will developing this attribute help me qualify for the Holy Spirit and become a more powerful minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - Find examples of Christlike attributes in the lives of men and women in the scriptures. Record your impressions in your study journal. ### Companion Study (Page 138) - Study references to Christlike attributes in the missionary library. - Discuss relationships among different attributes. For example: - How does faith relate to diligence? - In what ways are humility and love related? - How does knowledge strengthen patience? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 138) - Several days before district meeting or zone conference, ask each missionary to select one of the attributes in this chapter or in the scriptures and prepare a five- minute talk on that attribute, including scriptures that have helped him or her. Allow time in the meeting for a few missionaries to share their talks. - Divide the missionaries into three groups, and give them the following assignment: Group 1: Read 1 Nephi 17:7–16 and answer the following questions: - How did Nephi exercise his faith? - What did Nephi do that was Christlike? - What promises did the Lord make to Nephi if he would be faithful and keep the commandments? - How does this account apply to missionary work? Group 2: Read Jacob 7:1–15 and answer the following questions: - Why was Jacob’s faith strong enough to resist Sherem’s attack? - How did Jacob exercise faith when he talked with Sherem? - How were Jacob’s actions Christlike? - What can we do to develop faith like Jacob’s? Group 3: Read Joseph Smith—History 1:8–18, and answer the following questions: - In what ways did Joseph Smith exercise faith in Jesus Christ? - How was his faith tried? - What did he do that was Christlike? - What can we do to follow Joseph Smith’s example? After the groups finish, bring the missionaries together and ask them to share what they discussed. - Share an experience of when you were blessed or inspired by another person’s faith. - Have missionaries refer to the “Attribute Activity. - Page 140” Give each missionary a piece of paper on which to write his or her answers. - When they have completed the worksheet, invite them to set personal goals. - Ask a few of the missionaries to share what they learned and felt as they completed the worksheet. - Share your testimony concerning the importance of developing Christlike attributes. ### Mission President (Page 139) - Ask missionaries to read one of the four Gospels in the New Testament or 3 Nephi 11–28. Have them underline what the Savior did that they can also do. - Use goal setting and planning to teach missionaries about diligence. Show how diligence in focusing on people is an expression of love. - During interviews, ask missionaries to talk about an attribute they are trying to develop. - In a zone conference, invite missionaries to tell about Christlike attributes they admire in their companions. > Beginning of chapter 7 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual #']","Goal setting and daily planning sessions are crucial for effective missionary work as they provide a structured approach to achieving missionary objectives. During goal setting, missionaries determine how to help people attend sacrament meetings and keep commitments, plan to find new investigators, and work with ward councils. Daily planning sessions, conducted at the end of each day, involve reviewing and revising goals and schedules, ensuring that every hour is meaningfully planned. This structured approach, combined with prayerful consideration and accountability, helps missionaries stay focused and proactive in their efforts, ultimately enhancing their ability to teach and engage with others effectively."

When that day comes: - What do you want to say you have done as a missionary? - What do you want to have become? - What differences would you want others to notice in you? In your study journal, write an answer to each of these questions. Determine what you need to do now to realize these goals. Write the plans that come to mind. ### Companion Study (Page 166) - Using your area book, answer the questions below: - Are all the records current, accurate, and easy to read? - Would a missionary who is new to the area be able to review the area book and know where people are in their spiritual progress and what more needs to be done to help them? - Would a missionary who is new to the area benefit from your efforts to find new investigators? - Picture yourself presenting your area book to the Lord as you give an accounting of how you have cared for the people in your area. Would the Lord be pleased with your efforts? - Discuss one of your new investigators. In your Missionary Daily Planner, locate the page titled “Events That Lead to Baptism, Confirmation, and Activity in the Church.” Select one event, and make a list of everything you need to do in order for this event to happen. Discuss how you might plan these tasks so that the event can happen at the earliest possible time. - Discuss the following analogy with your companion. Evaluate how long your “line” is in the water each day. “None of us should be like the fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and fussing with his equipment. Fishing success is related to how long you have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the apartment. Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for ten hours. Other fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two hours. This last type may wonder why they do not have the same success as others. “The same principle applies to missionaries, whom the Master called ‘fishers of men.’ A missionary’s line should drop into the fishing water the moment he or she leaves the apartment” (Dallin H. Oaks, seminar for new mission presidents, June 20, 2000). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 166) - Read one of the following situations to the missionaries. In small groups, have the missionaries discuss goals and plans that will help the people in these examples progress toward baptism and confirmation. Have each group share their ideas. - Situation one: You met Larry and Beth when they were giving service at a food kitchen. You have taught them one lesson, and now they want to know more. They do not know any members of the Church. Beth is Christian, and Larry does not claim any particular religion. They are not married but do live together. Larry works from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. Beth works daytime hours. - Situation two: Steve has taken all the lessons and attends church at least twice a month. He believes that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that the Book of Mormon is true. His family members are devout Catholics and do not approve of his meetings with the missionaries. - Situation three: Jill is a college student. She has a friend who is @ member of the Church. Her member friend invited her to meet with you. You have taught her two lessons. Her member friend was present at both. She has not attended church yet and is so busy with her homework that it is difficult for her to read from the Book of Mormon. - Invite missionaries to share experiences where, through setting goals and making plans, they have been able to help people: - Develop greater faith in the Savior. - Repent and make changes that have brought them closer to God. - Receive the covenant of baptism and confirmation. - Come back to the Church and renew their baptismal covenant. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Explain that each group will receive an important assignment. Then give each group one of the following tasks: - Open a new proselyting area. - Prepare a zone conference training session on introducing the Book of Mormon 0 to investigators. - Integrate an investigator family into the ward. The family has three children: an 8-year-old girl, a 12-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old boy. Tell the missionaries they have eight minutes to develop a plan. One of the missionaries should write the plan down, including the daily activities. Have each group present its plan. After each presentation, ask: - What did the missionaries need to know in each situation? - What might the result be if you do not plan meaningful activities or do not plan at all? After all the presentations, ask: - How are planning and goal setting acts of love? acts of faith? ### Mission President (Page 167) - Ask missionaries to bring their area books to zone conference or to interviews.

He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world. Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal. The Family of God. All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see Acts 17:26–29; Hebrews 12:9). We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious . . . ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (Alma 31:34–35). “Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message.']","Missionaries can effectively set and achieve their goals by focusing their efforts on their purpose, setting goals according to key indicators, and praying mightily over their goals and plans. They should use tools like the area book and the Missionary Daily Planner to help people develop faith, repent, be baptized, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. Conducting weekly and daily planning sessions that focus on helping others progress in the gospel is crucial. Additionally, missionaries should account for their efforts to the Lord and to mission leaders. President Thomas S. Monson emphasized that when performance is measured, performance improves, and when it is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates. This principle encourages missionaries to use performance measurement as a means to enhance their dedication and identify opportunities for future training."
How do prayer and the Book of Mormon work together to guide missionaries in their teaching and conversion efforts?,"['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 115) - Talk about the prayers you offer as companions. Are they guided by the Holy Ghost? Have you received answers to your prayers? When you pray as companions, do you: – Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness? – Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers? – Pray for people by name and consider their needs? – Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you? – Receive answers to your prayers? - Discuss as companions how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly. - Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost. Write comments that investigators have made about their experiences with the Spirit in learning the gospel and trying to keep commitments. How can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 116) - Occasionally ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you. - In interviews, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers. Ask them if they feel their prayers are meaningful. - Ask missionaries how they help investigators feel and recognize the Spirit. - As appropriate, relate to missionaries how you receive revelation on transfers, missionaries who are disobedient or need help, and doctrines to teach. > Beginning of Chapter 5 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon? (Page 117) #### Consider This - How is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion? - How does the Book of Mormon answer the great questions of the soul? - Why is the Book of Mormon so powerful in the conversion process? - How should I use the Book of Mormon to build faith and help others to draw closer to God? - Why is the promise in Moroni 10:3–5 central in missionary work? ## Overview (Page 117) The Book of Mormon is powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion (Page 117) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (History of the Church, 2:52). An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge- shaped pieces that lean against each other. The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways: - Witness of Christ. “The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.” - Fulness of doctrine. “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (D&C 20:9 [;27:5].) . . . In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation. And they are taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.” - Foundation of testimony. “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” (A Witness and a Warning [1988], 18–19). The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach investigators. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach investigators. | Missionary Lesson | Doctrines | References | | --- | --- | --- | | The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ | Apostasy, Restoration, Joseph Smith, priesthood authority | 1 Nephi 12-14 2 Nephi 3; 26-29 Mosiah 18 | | The Plan of Salvation | The “great plan of the eternal God,” including the Fall of Adam, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the Judgment | 2 Nephi 2; 9 Mosiah 3; 15 Alma 12; 40-42 | | The Gospel of Jesus Christ | Faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end | 2 Nephi 31-32 3 Nephi 11; 27 | | The Commandments; Laws and Ordinances | Ordinances such as baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament | 3 Nephi 11:22-28; 18 Moroni 2-6 |', '<4-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##', '<5-hop>\n\nIdeas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","Prayer and the Book of Mormon are integral to missionaries' teaching and conversion efforts. Prayer is emphasized as a means of receiving divine guidance and answers, as missionaries are encouraged to pray with faith, gratitude, and sincerity, believing that God will respond to righteous requests (as seen in <1-hop>). The Book of Mormon, described as the keystone of the religion, provides powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ and the Restoration through Joseph Smith. It is essential for conversion, as missionaries are taught to have a personal testimony of its truth, which can lead to a deep faith in its power during the conversion process (as seen in <2-hop> and <3-hop>). Together, prayer and the Book of Mormon help missionaries build faith, receive guidance from the Holy Ghost, and effectively teach the gospel, inviting others to seek their own spiritual confirmations through prayer and study."
"In the context of companion study and spiritual guidance, how can a Latter-day Saint family counselor effectively adjust their teaching approach to address the unique needs and concerns of an individual, such as an older man who is grieving the loss of his wife, has a heart condition, and is questioning the existence of God?","['<1-hop>\n\nActivity: Companion Study (Page 191) With your companion, practice different ways to begin a lesson using several of these suggestions. ## Adjust Your Teaching to Meet Needs (Page 191) Each person or family you teach is unique. Even though you will not understand all of their interests, achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to their circumstances. Regardless of needs or problems, all people are best helped as they accept and live the gospel. You will be able to adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the Spirit. You may alter the order of the lessons as you are inspired to adapt to the investigators’ interests and needs. You may use more than one meeting to teach the principles in one lesson, and occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons in a single meeting. Heavenly Father knows His children, so rely on inspiration to make these decisions as you teach. Pray for the gift of discernment, and pay attention to thoughts that come to your mind or feelings you have about what to teach. You will need to adjust your teaching to give more attention to those commitments that are more difficult for an investigator to keep. For example, one person may easily accept the Book of Mormon as the word of God, while another may struggle to accept anything but the Bible. One person may have trouble giving up tobacco but will readily accept the law of tithing. As you plan when to teach certain doctrines, be sensitive about how much new information you share. Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the investigators. Some will progress faster or slower than others. Make sure that you ask enough questions and listen carefully to their answers so you have a firm understanding of how quickly and how well the investigator is learning and applying the doctrines you are presenting. Be sensitive to time. Most teaching appointments should not last beyond 45 minutes. A teaching visit can be completed, however, in 15 or 20 minutes if needed. If the person has only 15 minutes to meet with you, adjust your teaching to respect that limitation. Trust in the promise that the Spirit will give you “in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say” (D&C 100:6). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 192) Imagine that you are walking down the street and notice an older man struggling to place some heavy bags into a garbage can. You and your companion help him, and as a result he asks who you are. After some discussion he invites you into his home and agrees to hear your message. During the initial conversation he tells you that: - His wife died a year ago, and he really misses her. - He tires easily because of a heart condition. - He wonders more now than ever before whether God exists. What might you teach him? How could you adjust your teaching to best meet his needs and concerns?']","A Latter-day Saint family counselor can effectively adjust their teaching approach by being sensitive to the unique circumstances and needs of the individual they are teaching. In the case of an older man who is grieving the loss of his wife, has a heart condition, and is questioning the existence of God, the counselor should rely on spiritual guidance and the promptings of the Spirit to tailor their message. They should pray for the gift of discernment to understand the man's concerns and adjust the pace and content of their teaching accordingly. The counselor might focus on doctrines that provide comfort and hope, such as the eternal nature of families and the love of Heavenly Father, while being mindful of the man's physical limitations and emotional state. By asking thoughtful questions and listening carefully to his responses, the counselor can ensure that the teachings are relevant and supportive, helping the man to feel understood and spiritually uplifted."
"How can missionaries ensure they are guided by the Spirit while teaching, and what role does the Holy Ghost play in using scriptures during lessons?","['<1-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (page 192) - What does it mean to give “that portion that shall be meted unto every man”? - Alma 29:8, D&C 84:85 - What has the Lord promised faithful missionaries? - D&C 68:2–4, D&C 100:5–8, Matthew 10:19–20 ## Teach with Your Companion in Unity (Page 192) The Lord has commanded, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” (D&C 42:6). Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work together in unity. As you plan and study each day, discuss how you will teach so that you can be united and teach with one voice. Your teaching will be more powerful if you and your companion alternate giving brief portions of the lesson. Avoid falling into a routine when presenting the message. Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths of which he or she has testified. Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something. As companions, be ready to yield to each other so that you do not hinder the guidance of the Spirit. When you speak, maintain eye contact with the investigator. When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the investigator’s responses. #### Scripture Study (Page 193) - How do companions support one another? - Alma 12:1, D&C 42:6, D&C 52:9–10 ## Invite Members to Help You Teach (Page 193) Whenever possible invite members, preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the investigators. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of missionary work. It also provides friendship for the investigator. President Thomas S. Monson taught: *During the teaching process investigators can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new investigators so that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps the second or third visit. Can you appreciate, for example, when missionaries are working with those from the United Church of Canada, the strength of testimony of Brother and Sister William Stoneman, who had come from the United Church of Canada. Brother Stoneman, a printer, would say, “When I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was the lead printer for the United Church. I lost my job. But I found a better job. Even more, I found the truth in its entirety. You too can make the adjustment. You too can make the same decision. In fact, let us pick you up on Sunday morning so that we can sit together in church. Then you can hear and feel for yourself. We’ll be right by your side.” Anthony and Edith Belfiglio became such a fellowshipping couple to those who had Roman Catholic roots. The result was the same. It can be done. And such converts stay converted. In addition, the couples chosen to fulfill this assignment put their own roots even deeper in the rich soil of the gospel. Both Brother Stoneman and Brother Belfiglio became ordained patriarchs. The combined efforts of members and missionaries in such specific cooperation yield an abundant gathering of precious souls (missionary training satellite broadcast, 25 Apr. 2003).* ####', '<2-hop>\n\nUse the Scriptures (Page 194) The standard works of the Church are your basic sources for teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. You may also use the words of living prophets. There are many reasons why it is vital to use the scriptures as the basis for your teaching. For example: - The Lord and His prophets have instructed us to do so (see D&C 42:12, 56–58; 71:1). A latter-day prophet counseled, “The words and the way they are used in the Book of Mormon by the Lord . . . should be used by us in teaching gospel principles” (Ezra Taft Benson, “The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants,” Ensign, May 1987, 84). - The scriptures invite the Holy Ghost into your teaching. They teach God’s word with power (see Alma 31:5). - The scriptures answer the great questions of the soul (see 2 Nephi 32:3; Jacob 2:8). - The scriptures give authority and validity to your teaching, even in areas without a Christian background. Your ability to teach with power from the scriptures comes in large measure from the time you personally spend studying them. As you daily feast upon the word, your ability to teach from the scriptures will improve. In addition, your invitations to study and ponder the scriptures will be more powerful because you are doing the same thing in your life. Help people gain faith in the scriptures— particularly the Book of Mormon—as sources of revealed truth. When people come to believe the scriptures, you will be better able to help them understand doctrines correctly. The following suggestions may help. 1. Introduce the scripture. Describe briefly the background and context of the passage you will use. Invite the investigator to look for particular points in the passage. When teaching people with a limited knowledge of the scriptures, you may need to begin by describing the contents of a passage, using language that they will understand. Below are examples of introducing a scripture: - “Here in Joseph Smith’s history we have Joseph’s own words telling what happened to him as he went into the grove to pray. He said, ‘I saw a pillar of light . . .’ ” - “In this passage the prophet Alma is teaching people who are poor to exercise their faith in the word of God. He compares the word of God to a seed that can be planted in our hearts. Will you begin reading verse . . .” 2. Read the passage. Read the verses aloud or ask the investigator to read aloud. Be sensitive to those who struggle to read. If a passage is difficult for them to understand, read with them carefully and help them understand the more difficult points. Or give them a simpler passage to read. You might also define difficult words or phrases: - “Let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not [‘upbraideth not’ means that God won’t find blame or fault] and it shall be given him” (James 1:5). Some scriptural passages are clear and need no explanation. For others you may take time to explain what has been read. 3. Apply the scripture. “Liken” the scriptures to yourself and to investigators by showing how the principles are relevant today (see 1 Nephi 19:23). Show investigators how they can apply the principles in their lives. As they do, they will come to know that the doctrine is true. Bear your testimony of the principle, and promise them blessings. For example: - “The people of Alma, like you, had heavy burdens placed on them, almost more than they could bear. But as they exercised faith and ‘cried mightily to God,’ He strengthened them so they could endure the challenges and then delivered them from their trials. Just as He did with these people, I know God will help you in your trials as you . . .” - “Alma’s instruction to the people at the waters of Mormon applies to us today. John, are you willing to . . .” The people you teach will differ widely in how they view sacred texts, how familiar they are with the Bible, how well they understand scriptural language, and how deeply they believe that the Bible contains God’s word. Help all investigators gain an appreciation for the scriptures. By effectively using the scriptures in your teaching, you can help investigators begin to study the scriptures on their own. After each visit, suggest specific chapters or verses for them to read. You might give them questions to consider as they read, which you can discuss in your next meeting. This will encourage them to study the scriptures daily in their homes and participate in Church meetings and classes where the scriptures are used.']","Missionaries can ensure they are guided by the Spirit while teaching by working in unity with their companions, as instructed in D&C 42:6, which emphasizes going forth in the power of the Spirit. They should plan and study together, alternating in giving portions of the lesson, and be ready to yield to each other to avoid hindering the Spirit's guidance. Maintaining eye contact with the investigator and praying for their companion are also important practices. The Holy Ghost plays a crucial role in using scriptures during lessons by inviting its presence into the teaching, as the scriptures teach God's word with power (Alma 31:5). The scriptures also provide authority and validity to the teachings, helping to answer the great questions of the soul (2 Nephi 32:3; Jacob 2:8). By daily studying the scriptures, missionaries can improve their ability to teach with power and help investigators gain faith in the scriptures as sources of revealed truth."
"How can missionaries effectively help less-active members and new converts regain their 'desire and purpose' to bring souls to Christ, as emphasized in the teachings of President Joseph F. Smith and the guidance provided by mission leaders?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 236) - During ward council meeting, ask the bishop if there are any less-active members in your area he would like you to visit this week. As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for yourself and for others. - Rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Be exactly obedient. • Study the language of your mission each day. - Plan every day and focus on the key indicators. - Work effectively all day, every day. - Ask for referrals from everyone! - Teach when you find; find when you teach. - Read the Book of Mormon with those you teach. - Teach people that an important way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. - Contact every investigator daily. - Bear testimony frequently. - Have a member at every lesson possible. - Always set specific dates and times for the next lesson. - Invite all investigators to baptismal services. - After each lesson, provide investigators with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. - Build relationships with members by serving them and working with the leadership of the ward. - Help ward leaders with retention and activation activities. - Help everyone you teach make commitments that will bring about repentance and will strengthen their faith in the Savior. - Love the Lord and serve Him the very best you can.']","Missionaries can effectively help less-active members and new converts regain their 'desire and purpose' to bring souls to Christ by following several key strategies. According to the teachings of President Joseph F. Smith, maintaining the initial spirit and earnest desire experienced at baptism is crucial, even though challenges and mistakes may occur. Missionaries are encouraged to work closely with local priesthood leaders to support new converts in their spiritual journey, such as helping them be ordained to the priesthood, receive home teachers, and prepare for temple ordinances. Additionally, missionaries should focus on building relationships with members, serving them, and working with ward leadership on retention and activation activities. By praying often, relying on the Spirit, and being exactly obedient, missionaries can guide less-active members and new converts to strengthen their faith in the Savior and renew their commitment to the gospel."
"How can missionaries effectively use prayer and the role of scriptures to teach the restored gospel to individuals without a Christian background, and what scriptural examples support this approach?","['<1-hop>\n\nTeach the Restored Gospel to Those without a Christian Background (Page 204) Some of the people whom you will teach may not believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ or have a Christian tradition. Many of these people, however, will have beliefs, practices, and places which they hold sacred. As a servant of God, it is essential that you show proper respect for their religious beliefs and traditions. Do not do anything that would show disrespect for that which is important to them. You may wonder how you should adjust your teaching approach to these people. It will be helpful to remember that in order to be converted, all of God’s children, regardless of background, must develop faith in Jesus Christ, repent, receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, and endure to the end by keeping the commandments and giving service. The principles that help others build faith in Jesus Christ are the same in all cultures. You can help people gain a correct understanding of God as our Heavenly Father and develop faith in Jesus Christ by helping them have personal spiritual experiences rather than simply telling them about the nature of God. For example, you will help people gain this understanding as they: - Gain a spiritual conviction that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. - Hear your sincere teaching and testimony of the gospel, including why you chose to follow Jesus Christ. - Frequently hear you and other members talk to Heavenly Father in a simple, heartfelt prayer. - Hear you bear powerful testimony. - Pray with you and on their own. - Come to learn how you feel about the scriptures as you read and discuss them. - Read God’s word from the scriptures daily (especially the Book of Mormon). - Attend church so they can see how we worship the Lord. - Meet members of the Church who can explain how they came to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. - Keep the commandments. These activities are beneficial for all people you teach, but they are essential when teaching those without a Christian background because these people are less likely to have had these experiences previously. Many converts from non-Christian backgrounds report that they did not understand much of what the missionaries were saying but that they felt the Spirit and wanted to do what the missionaries asked. You must do all you can to help investigators understand the doctrines of the gospel. Be patient and supportive, as it may take some time for people to learn to identify and express the feelings they have inside. You may need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching to help them understand. As you prepare to teach those without a Christian background, the following suggestions may help: - Provide simple overviews and reviews for each lesson. - Ask them to tell you what they understand and what they have experienced. - Take the time to define essential words and principles. Those you teach may not be familiar with many of the words you will use as you teach. - Return to a previously taught lesson to teach the doctrine more clearly. This may be necessary any time in the teaching process. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nScriptural Examples (Page 206) The scriptures contain examples of missionaries who have taught those who did not believe in God or who misunderstood His true nature. Study the scriptures below, and then explain to your companion or record in your study journal how these missionaries helped people gain a testimony that God exists. - Alma and Amulek (Alma 9–12; 15) - Ammon and Aaron (Alma 17–22) - Alma (Alma 30) - Alma and others (Alma 31–35) - Paul (Acts 17:16–34) #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 206) When possible, identify a convert who was not part of a Christian tradition before meeting with the missionaries. Arrange to meet with him or her, and ask about his or her conversion experience. For example, you might ask what led the person to believe in God, the first time he or she prayed, the first time he or she felt an answer to prayer, the role of the scriptures in his or her conversion, and what it was like to attend Sunday services. Write what you learn in your study journal. #### Remember This (Page 206) - As people are taught the restored gospel and live it, their needs will be met. - Plan and study each day with your companion to be united and to teach with one voice. - Share your testimony frequently. - The scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, are your basic sources for teaching. - Pray for the gift of discernment to know when to use the skills described in this chapter. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nHow to Begin Teaching (Page 190) The first few moments with investigators are very important. Investigators must learn to trust you. Begin your first visit in a warm, respectful, genuine manner. Ask a few simple questions to help you understand their religious background and their expectations regarding your visits. For example, ask, “What role has religion played in your life?” Do not, however, ask personal questions that would make them uncomfortable. Before you begin, ask all who are present to join with you in the lesson. Encourage them to turn off the television and remove other distractions so that the Spirit of the Lord will not be hindered. Explain that you would like to begin and end each lesson in prayer. Suggest that you will offer the opening prayer. Pray simply but fervently that the Lord will bless the people you are teaching in every aspect of their lives, and especially that they can feel the truth of what you will teach. Demonstrate sincere interest and love for the investigators and faith in the converting power of the gospel (see Moroni 7:43–48). As guided by the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following to your investigators: - Because God is our Heavenly Father, we are all brothers and sisters. We would like to refer to you as brothers and sisters. - Each person we teach has personal challenges and concerns. No matter what your needs or concerns might be, the Savior and His teachings—the gospel—will help you. - Our message will enable you to improve the quality of your lives. It will help you deal with the problems and challenges that we all face in life. - Our message, which is centered in Jesus Christ, is of great value and importance. - We all make mistakes in life, and these mistakes create feelings of guilt and shame. These feelings cannot be relieved without repentance and forgiveness. They can be fully healed through the Atonement of Christ. - Our message cannot be learned all at once. Understanding will come over time through prayer, study, experience, and keeping God’s commandments. - We have weaknesses, as everyone does. We may not speak the language very well or be able to answer every question you have. But we have been called by a prophet of God to share what we know. We know that our message is true. - We will be guides so that you can learn the truth of our message for yourselves. It is your choice to accept and act on the message. Therefore, you should feel free to ask questions. - As you sincerely seek to understand our message, you may face challenges, but God will help you. - As you accept our message, you will learn how to make covenants, or promises, with God. You will learn how to make changes to bring your lives in closer harmony with His teachings. You will want to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be baptized by proper authority (see John 3:5). Before teaching the doctrines in a lesson, consider giving a simple overview of what you are going to teach. Help people see that it will have personal relevance for them. Many of the investigators you teach have been prepared by the Lord (see Alma 16:16–17). As you share spiritual experiences together in the first meeting, they will recognize you as servants of the Lord. ####']","Missionaries can effectively use prayer and the role of scriptures to teach the restored gospel to individuals without a Christian background by helping them have personal spiritual experiences. This includes frequently hearing missionaries and other members talk to Heavenly Father in simple, heartfelt prayer, praying with the missionaries and on their own, and reading God's word from the scriptures daily, especially the Book of Mormon. These activities help individuals gain a spiritual conviction and understanding of God as our Heavenly Father and develop faith in Jesus Christ. Scriptural examples that support this approach include missionaries like Alma and Amulek, Ammon and Aaron, and Paul, who taught those who did not believe in God or misunderstood His true nature. These examples demonstrate how missionaries helped people gain a testimony that God exists through their teachings and the use of scriptures."
"How can personal study and reflection enhance a missionary's effectiveness in finding and teaching people, and what role does accountability play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 166) ### Personal Study (Page 166) - In your study journal, write a one-sentence answer for each of the questions in “Consider This.” - Take a few moments and think about your final day in the mission field. When that day comes: - What do you want to say you have done as a missionary? - What do you want to have become? - What differences would you want others to notice in you? In your study journal, write an answer to each of these questions. Determine what you need to do now to realize these goals. Write the plans that come to mind. ### Companion Study (Page 166) - Using your area book, answer the questions below: - Are all the records current, accurate, and easy to read? - Would a missionary who is new to the area be able to review the area book and know where people are in their spiritual progress and what more needs to be done to help them? - Would a missionary who is new to the area benefit from your efforts to find new investigators? - Picture yourself presenting your area book to the Lord as you give an accounting of how you have cared for the people in your area. Would the Lord be pleased with your efforts? - Discuss one of your new investigators. In your Missionary Daily Planner, locate the page titled “Events That Lead to Baptism, Confirmation, and Activity in the Church.” Select one event, and make a list of everything you need to do in order for this event to happen. Discuss how you might plan these tasks so that the event can happen at the earliest possible time. - Discuss the following analogy with your companion. Evaluate how long your “line” is in the water each day. “None of us should be like the fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and fussing with his equipment. Fishing success is related to how long you have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the apartment. Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for ten hours. Other fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two hours. This last type may wonder why they do not have the same success as others. “The same principle applies to missionaries, whom the Master called ‘fishers of men.’ A missionary’s line should drop into the fishing water the moment he or she leaves the apartment” (Dallin H. Oaks, seminar for new mission presidents, June 20, 2000). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 166) - Read one of the following situations to the missionaries. In small groups, have the missionaries discuss goals and plans that will help the people in these examples progress toward baptism and confirmation. Have each group share their ideas. - Situation one: You met Larry and Beth when they were giving service at a food kitchen. You have taught them one lesson, and now they want to know more. They do not know any members of the Church. Beth is Christian, and Larry does not claim any particular religion. They are not married but do live together. Larry works from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. Beth works daytime hours. - Situation two: Steve has taken all the lessons and attends church at least twice a month. He believes that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that the Book of Mormon is true. His family members are devout Catholics and do not approve of his meetings with the missionaries. - Situation three: Jill is a college student. She has a friend who is @ member of the Church. Her member friend invited her to meet with you. You have taught her two lessons. Her member friend was present at both. She has not attended church yet and is so busy with her homework that it is difficult for her to read from the Book of Mormon. - Invite missionaries to share experiences where, through setting goals and making plans, they have been able to help people: - Develop greater faith in the Savior. - Repent and make changes that have brought them closer to God. - Receive the covenant of baptism and confirmation. - Come back to the Church and renew their baptismal covenant. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Explain that each group will receive an important assignment. Then give each group one of the following tasks: - Open a new proselyting area. - Prepare a zone conference training session on introducing the Book of Mormon 0 to investigators. - Integrate an investigator family into the ward. The family has three children: an 8-year-old girl, a 12-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old boy. Tell the missionaries they have eight minutes to develop a plan. One of the missionaries should write the plan down, including the daily activities. Have each group present its plan. After each presentation, ask: - What did the missionaries need to know in each situation? - What might the result be if you do not plan meaningful activities or do not plan at all? After all the presentations, ask: - How are planning and goal setting acts of love? acts of faith? ### Mission President (Page 167) - Ask missionaries to bring their area books to zone conference or to interviews. In addition to reviewing the area books yourself, consider having mission leaders or your wife review the area books. - Occasionally observe missionaries’ weekly or daily planning sessions. - Occasionally conduct interviews in missionary apartments. As you do so, have your wife or the assistants to the president review missionaries’ area books and daily planners. - Frequently review missionaries’ daily planners. - Occasionally attend a ward council meeting. > Beginning of Chapter 9', '<2-hop>\n\nDo not use these tools or the information you receive as ways to control or manipulate.

He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world. Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal. The Family of God. All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see Acts 17:26–29; Hebrews 12:9). We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious . . . ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (Alma 31:34–35). “Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message.']","Personal study and reflection are crucial for missionaries as they help in setting and achieving goals that align with their purpose, such as developing faith, repentance, and baptism among those they teach. By writing answers to reflective questions about their mission goals and planning steps to achieve them, missionaries can better prepare themselves for their work in the field. Accountability plays a significant role in this process, as it involves measuring and reporting performance, which leads to improvement. This is supported by the teachings of President Thomas S. Monson, who emphasized that performance improves when it is measured and reported. Additionally, accountability ensures that missionaries focus their efforts on their purpose and use tools like the area book and Missionary Daily Planner effectively to help people progress in the gospel."
"How does scripture study enhance a missionary's ability to teach by the Spirit, and what role does teaching with a companion play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nStudying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain the baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). ####', '<3-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (page 192) - What does it mean to give “that portion that shall be meted unto every man”? - Alma 29:8, D&C 84:85 - What has the Lord promised faithful missionaries? - D&C 68:2–4, D&C 100:5–8, Matthew 10:19–20 ## Teach with Your Companion in Unity (Page 192) The Lord has commanded, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” (D&C 42:6). Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work together in unity. As you plan and study each day, discuss how you will teach so that you can be united and teach with one voice. Your teaching will be more powerful if you and your companion alternate giving brief portions of the lesson. Avoid falling into a routine when presenting the message. Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths of which he or she has testified. Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something. As companions, be ready to yield to each other so that you do not hinder the guidance of the Spirit. When you speak, maintain eye contact with the investigator. When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the investigator’s responses. #### Scripture Study (Page 193) - How do companions support one another? - Alma 12:1, D&C 42:6, D&C 52:9–10 ## Invite Members to Help You Teach (Page 193) Whenever possible invite members, preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the investigators. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of missionary work. It also provides friendship for the investigator. President Thomas S. Monson taught: *During the teaching process investigators can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new investigators so that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps the second or third visit. Can you appreciate, for example, when missionaries are working with those from the United Church of Canada, the strength of testimony of Brother and Sister William Stoneman, who had come from the United Church of Canada. Brother Stoneman, a printer, would say, “When I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was the lead printer for the United Church. I lost my job. But I found a better job. Even more, I found the truth in its entirety. You too can make the adjustment. You too can make the same decision. In fact, let us pick you up on Sunday morning so that we can sit together in church. Then you can hear and feel for yourself. We’ll be right by your side.” Anthony and Edith Belfiglio became such a fellowshipping couple to those who had Roman Catholic roots. The result was the same. It can be done. And such converts stay converted. In addition, the couples chosen to fulfill this assignment put their own roots even deeper in the rich soil of the gospel. Both Brother Stoneman and Brother Belfiglio became ordained patriarchs. The combined efforts of members and missionaries in such specific cooperation yield an abundant gathering of precious souls (missionary training satellite broadcast, 25 Apr. 2003).* ####', '<4-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 39) 1.

Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to make the message easy to understand. ### Scripture Study (Page 44) What are you directed to teach? Study Mosiah 18:18–20, D&C 43:15–16 and D&C 52:9 to find the answers to this question. Why must you study the doctrines in the lessons? Study Alma 17:2–3 and D&C 84:85 to find answers to this question. > Lesson One # 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 45) ## Your Purpose (Page 45) As you teach, prepare your investigators to meet the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the baptismal interview questions. This is best accomplished by inviting your investigators to make and keep the commitments listed below. ### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 45) - Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father?']","Scripture study enhances a missionary's ability to teach by the Spirit by providing a deep understanding of the gospel doctrines, which is essential for teaching with spiritual power. As missionaries study scriptures such as 1 Nephi 10:17–19 and D&C 88:118, they gain insights that strengthen their testimony and ability to teach effectively. This preparation allows them to teach in their own words, guided by the Spirit, and helps them focus on the central messages and doctrines, as outlined in the lessons. Additionally, teaching with a companion plays a crucial role in this process. According to D&C 42:6, teaching in unity with a companion makes the teaching more powerful and interesting. Companions support each other by alternating portions of the lesson, offering a second witness to the truths being taught, and following the Spirit's guidance. This unity ensures that the message is delivered with clarity and conviction, enhancing the overall teaching experience and helping investigators strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ."
"How do prayer and the Book of Mormon work together to guide missionaries in their efforts to teach and convert others, according to the teachings in the Preach My Gospel manual?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 115) - Talk about the prayers you offer as companions. Are they guided by the Holy Ghost? Have you received answers to your prayers? When you pray as companions, do you: – Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness? – Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers? – Pray for people by name and consider their needs? – Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you? – Receive answers to your prayers? - Discuss as companions how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly. - Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost. Write comments that investigators have made about their experiences with the Spirit in learning the gospel and trying to keep commitments. How can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 116) - Occasionally ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you. - In interviews, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers. Ask them if they feel their prayers are meaningful. - Ask missionaries how they help investigators feel and recognize the Spirit. - As appropriate, relate to missionaries how you receive revelation on transfers, missionaries who are disobedient or need help, and doctrines to teach. > Beginning of Chapter 5 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon? (Page 117) #### Consider This - How is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion? - How does the Book of Mormon answer the great questions of the soul? - Why is the Book of Mormon so powerful in the conversion process? - How should I use the Book of Mormon to build faith and help others to draw closer to God? - Why is the promise in Moroni 10:3–5 central in missionary work? ## Overview (Page 117) The Book of Mormon is powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion (Page 117) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (History of the Church, 2:52). An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge- shaped pieces that lean against each other. The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways: - Witness of Christ. “The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.” - Fulness of doctrine. “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (D&C 20:9 [;27:5].) . . . In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation. And they are taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.” - Foundation of testimony. “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” (A Witness and a Warning [1988], 18–19). The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach investigators. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach investigators. | Missionary Lesson | Doctrines | References | | --- | --- | --- | | The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ | Apostasy, Restoration, Joseph Smith, priesthood authority | 1 Nephi 12-14 2 Nephi 3; 26-29 Mosiah 18 | | The Plan of Salvation | The “great plan of the eternal God,” including the Fall of Adam, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the Judgment | 2 Nephi 2; 9 Mosiah 3; 15 Alma 12; 40-42 | | The Gospel of Jesus Christ | Faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end | 2 Nephi 31-32 3 Nephi 11; 27 | | The Commandments; Laws and Ordinances | Ordinances such as baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament | 3 Nephi 11:22-28; 18 Moroni 2-6 |', '<4-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##', '<5-hop>\n\nIdeas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.', '<6-hop>\n\n“After several weeks of watching Brother Snider struggle, my companion and I felt impressed to again read 3 Nephi 11 with the Sniders. I will never forget what happened that night. As we opened the Book of Mormon, my companion explained, ‘This chapter, as you might recall, recounts the Savior’s visit to the people in the Book of Mormon. Here we read about the Savior’s love for these people and what He taught them.’ We each took turns reading a verse or two. After reading through verse 5, my companion interrupted and said, ‘I have always been impressed with the description given here of the voice they heard. The voice was not harsh, it was not loud, and although it was a small voice, it had a powerful piercing effect on them. This voice was not only heard with their ears, but it spoke to their hearts.’ I watched the Sniders as they listened intently to my companion. “After some discussion about prayer and listening to the Spirit, it was Brother Snider’s turn to read: ‘And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them: Behold my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.’ Brother Snider paused, looking intently at his Book of Mormon. Then he looked up at me and said, ‘Heavenly Father was really proud of His Son, wasn’t He?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. Brother Snider looked back at his book again and stared at the open pages as if deep in thought. Finally he said, ‘I would want Heavenly Father to be proud of me too. I wonder how He would introduce me. I guess, if I . . . well, if I want Him to be proud of me then I had better do what He wants me to do.’ ‘Yes, I think that would be important,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ Brother Snider continued. ‘I think I’ve been worrying too much about what everybody else thinks and not enough about what God thinks.’ After a brief pause Brother Snider nodded and with a determined look said, ‘I think I had better be baptized.’ His response was so unexpected that my companion and I looked at him with blank stares. Finally, my companion said, ‘Yes, that would be the right thing to do. In fact, later on in this chapter the Savior teaches . . .’ As my companion talked I felt a burning in my heart and gratitude for the power of the Book of Mormon.” How did these missionaries use the Book of Mormon? How will you and your companion use it more effectively in your missionary efforts? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 127) - Practice using the Book of Mormon in each of the ways mentioned in the main headings of this chapter. - List objections or questions raised by investigators. Explain to each other how you would answer these questions using the Book of Mormon. - Read Book of Mormon passages together. Share knowledge, feelings, and testimony. - Practice using the Book of Mormon to confirm the message of the Restoration. - Select one of the great Book of Mormon missionaries. Discuss and have missionaries list the characteristics of this missionary. Invite each missionary to set a goal to apply one of these characteristics. Repeat this activity regularly using Book of Mormon missionaries. - Invite missionaries to share experiences in which the Book of Mormon has helped their investigators in the conversion process. - Have missionaries share their best Book of Mormon answer to a question of the soul. ###', '<7-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 128) - Teach the missionaries how to use the Book of Mormon to confirm the truthfulness of the message of the Restoration. - Read 1 Nephi 1 with the missionaries and compare it with Joseph Smith’s experience. - Provide missionaries with a clean paperback copy of the Book of Mormon. Have them highlight in different colors: - Each reference to Jesus Christ (any of His names or pronouns referring to Him). - His words (spoken by Him or by prophets when they say, “Thus saith the Lord”). - His attributes. - The doctrines and principles contained in the Book of Mormon. At the bottom of each page ask the missionaries to count the total number of items referenced. In interviews and during district meetings during the two- or three-month period for this activity, have missionaries share with each other what they’ve learned. You might consider doing a similar activity with the entire mission highlighting references to faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, or any of the fundamental principles of the gospel. - During interviews, invite missionaries to share with you Book of Mormon scriptures that have changed their lives. - Help missionaries see how the Book of Mormon teaches the doctrines from the missionary lessons. For example, if the topic were the Atonement, have missionaries write in one column each major element of the Atonement taught in the Book of Mormon, including its references. Then, in a second column, have them list side-by-side those same elements as taught in the Bible. Have your missionaries leave blank those elements that are missing or not taught in the Bible. It will become very evident to the missionary how the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our doctrine. This same activity can be done with the other doctrines that missionaries teach. - Identify pertinent questions of the soul for people in your mission. Invite missionaries to find answers in the Book of Mormon. > Beginning of Chapter 6 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes? (Page 129) #### Consider This - How can I develop attributes that will make me a more powerful and effective minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How will developing Christlike attributes help me fulfill my purpose as a missionary? - Which attribute do I most need to develop? ## Overview (Page 129) At the beginning of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ walked along the shore of the sea of Galilee and called out to two fishermen, Peter and Andrew. “Follow me,” He said, “and I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew 4:19; see also Mark 1:17). The Lord has also called you to His work, and He invites you to follow Him. The invitation to follow Christ is an invitation to follow His example and to become like Him. Some chapters in Preach My Gospel focus on what you need to do as a missionary—how to study, how to teach, how to manage time wisely. Just as vital as what you do, however, is who you are. The restored gospel enables you to become like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The Savior has shown the way. He has set the perfect example, and He commands us to become as He is (see 3 Nephi 27:27). Learn of Him and seek to incorporate His attributes into your life. Through the power of His Atonement, you can achieve this goal and lead others to achieve it also. The scriptures describe Christlike attributes that are essential for you to eventually develop as a missionary and throughout your life. Study the scripture passages in this chapter and look for other examples of Christlike attributes as you study other passages. Christlike attributes are gifts from God. They come as you use your agency righteously. Ask your Heavenly Father to bless you with these attributes; you cannot develop them without His help. With a desire to please God, recognize your weaknesses and be willing and anxious to improve. #### Scripture Study (Page 130) - What do these scriptures say about following Jesus Christ’s example? - 3 Nephi 12:48, John 13:1–16, 1 Peter 2:21, 3 Nephi 27:21, 27 - What is the relationship between the first principles of the gospel and Christlike attributes? - Moroni 8:25–26']","Prayer and the Book of Mormon are integral to guiding missionaries in their efforts to teach and convert others, as outlined in the Preach My Gospel manual. Prayer is emphasized as a means of seeking divine guidance and creating a climate for spiritual growth. Missionaries are encouraged to pray with sincerity, expressing gratitude and seeking confirmation of the truths they teach, such as the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon (as seen in <1-hop> and <4-hop>). The Book of Mormon is described as the keystone of the religion, providing powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ and the Restoration through Joseph Smith. It is a central tool in conversion, as it contains the fulness of the gospel and is used to build faith and help others draw closer to God (as seen in <2-hop> and <3-hop>). Missionaries are taught to use the Book of Mormon to confirm the message of the Restoration and to answer questions of the soul, thereby facilitating the conversion process (as seen in <6-hop> and <7-hop>). Together, prayer and the Book of Mormon enable missionaries to receive personal testimony and guidance from the Holy Ghost, which is essential for effective teaching and conversion."
"How can missionaries effectively apply personal learning and language skills in their mission work, and what strategies are recommended for personal application of learning and missionary language learning?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ###', '<2-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching. Practice summarizing them in your own words. - Review the ideas in this chapter. Discuss which suggestions you could use in companion study during the next week. - If you are training a new missionary, take note of situations when your companion is not understood. Make a list of relevant words, phrases, or grammar that would help your companion. Explain and practice how to use what is on the list in upcoming, planned activities. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 148) - Invite native speakers to the meeting. Arrange for the missionaries to teach them in small groups. Ask the native speakers to take notes and give feedback on the missionaries’ language. - Assign one or two missionaries ahead of time to tell about successes they have had in studying the language. Have them share their ideas. - Assign an experienced missionary to present briefly some part of the language that is usually difficult for missionaries. Present examples of good usage, and have the missionaries practice them. - Have missionaries who are native to the culture share helpful insights. ### Mission President (Page 149) - Periodically interview missionaries in the language they are learning. - Ask local priesthood leaders for ideas on how missionaries can improve their language. - Identify the most common mistakes made by missionaries learning your mission language. Give instruction in zone conference on correcting these mistakes. - Teach missionaries the doctrine of spiritual gifts. - Observe your missionaries when they teach in the language. - Look for opportunities to use the language with your missionaries. > Beginning of chapter 7 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Use Time Wisely?

He wants you to watch over your area with love and great care. Your purpose is to help others come unto Him through baptism and confirmation. Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it. Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you. As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders. Your missionary call letter states: “You will also be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs. As you do these things the Lord will bless you and you will become an effective advocate and messenger of the truth. We place in you our confidence and pray that the Lord will help you meet your responsibilities in fulfilling this sacred assignment.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study Read Jacob 5:11–13, 61–64, 74–75, and answer these questions: - How does the Lord feel about His children? - What kind of effort does the Lord require of His servants? ##']","Missionaries can effectively apply personal learning and language skills in their mission work by integrating structured study practices and language learning strategies. For personal application of learning, missionaries are encouraged to 'liken' what they learn to themselves by setting goals to live what they are learning, personalizing scripture by substituting their name in verses, and evaluating how well they live the principles they teach. They should also engage in activities such as personal study, where they select scripture passages, ponder their application, and set improvement plans. For missionary language learning, strategies include practicing teaching each other the missionary lessons in the mission language, receiving feedback on pronunciation, summarizing scripture stories in their own words, and engaging in district meetings and zone conferences where native speakers provide feedback. Mission presidents also play a role by interviewing missionaries in the language they are learning and providing instruction on common mistakes. These combined efforts help missionaries become more effective in their roles by enhancing both their personal spiritual growth and their ability to communicate the gospel message effectively."
How can missionaries effectively incorporate prayer for divine assistance and a language study plan to enhance their teaching and personal growth?,"['<1-hop>\n\n- Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. - Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards. - Pray sincerely for divine assistance. - Study, practice, and use the mission language each day. ## Be Dedicated and Diligent (Page 142) Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort. Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language takes time. Be patient with yourself. Seek the help of your companion, members, investigators, and other missionaries. Do not stop improving your language skills once people begin to understand you. As your ability to speak the language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it. You will be less worried about how to communicate the feelings that are in your heart. You will be better able to respond to the needs of investigators and the promptings of the Spirit. Strive to master the language throughout your mission and after you return. The Lord has invested much in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your life. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained: “We would . . . hope that every missionary learning a new proselyting language would master it in every way possible. . . . And as you do so, your proselyting and testifying skills will improve. You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive to your investigators. . . . Don’t be satisfied with what we call a missionary vocabulary only. Stretch yourself in the language, and you will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (missionary satellite broadcast, Aug. 1998). You are not alone in learning your mission language. Whenever the Lord gives a commandment, He provides a way to accomplish it (see 1 Nephi 3:7). Seek His help. Be dedicated in your study. In time you will acquire the language skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. ## Learn English (Page 142) If you do not speak English, you should study it as a missionary. This will bless you during your mission and throughout your life. Learning English will enable you to help build the Lord’s kingdom in additional ways and will be a blessing for you and your family. Many of the suggestions found in this chapter will help you. Focus particularly on the following: - Set a goal to speak English with your companion. If your companion already knows English and is trying to learn your language, you might choose to speak English in the apartment and the mission language when you go out. - With your companion, read from the Book of Mormon in English. You might also choose to alternate: You read a verse in English, and then your companion reads a verse in the mission language. Correct each other’s pronunciation and intonation. - Ask your mission president for suggestions on a simple English grammar text if you do not already have one. ## Principles of Language Learning (Page 142) This section describes principles to help you study and learn the language more effectively. - **Take responsibility.** Regularly create or adjust your language learning goals and study plan. Strive to use the language at every opportunity. - **Make your study meaningful.** Ask yourself: Why am I studying this? How will it help me communicate better? Relate what you study to real-life situations and daily activities. Study parts of the language that will help you say what you want to say. For example, if there is a scripture story you would like to include in your teaching, learn the vocabulary and grammar necessary to relate it. - Seek to communicate. Seek to find an appropriate balance between studying grammar and the structure of the language and learning through your daily activities. There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language. - Learn new concepts thoroughly. You will be able to recall and effectively use language principles if you review regularly what you have studied and if you practice again in new situations. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nCreate a Language Study Plan (Page 143) A language study plan helps both new and experienced missionaries focus on what they can do each day to improve their ability to speak the mission language. Your plan will include what you will do during your language study time and what you will do throughout the day. As needed, use some of your language study time to create or adjust your study plan. Then each morning during your language study time, learn the language needed for the day’s activities. The following guidelines will help you in creating your own language learning plan: 1. Set goals. Weekly and daily goals will help you learn your mission language. Focus your goals on improving your ability to communicate and teach during scheduled activities, such as teaching appointments, finding opportunities, and ward council meetings. Review your progress in achieving your language goals. Ask yourself what you can do to communicate with greater clarity and power during your scheduled activities. 2. Select which tools to use. Review the following language tools and determine which you can use to achieve your goals: - The standard works in your mission language. - The lessons in your mission language. - A pocket-size dictionary. - A small grammar book. - MTC language materials. - Note cards. - A pocket notebook. - Other Church materials in your mission language. 3. Memorize vocabulary and phrases. Identify vocabulary and phrases that will help you accomplish your goals. Your language plan might include the following ideas: - Identify vocabulary and phrases in the lessons, brochures, scriptures, and other Church publications that you can use in teaching. - Record words or phrases you do not know in a notebook. Carry a small dictionary and look up these words. - Carry note cards to study throughout the day. Write a word or phrase on one side and the definition on the opposite side. Set aside the words you learn. Work on the remaining words until you know them all. - Use new words and phrases in sentences during personal study, teaching, and throughout the day. - Practice pronunciation by saying new words and phrases out loud. - Memorize key scriptures in the mission language. - Memorize simple statements from the lessons or brochures that convey key gospel principles. Find other ways to express these ideas. 4. Learn grammar. Use your language tools to identify grammar principles that will help you achieve your goals. If needed, ask your companion, an experienced missionary, or a member for help. Consider incorporating some of the following ideas: - Use the grammar text you received at the MTC or a text approved by your mission president to help you understand the grammar and sentence patterns found in the lessons, brochures, and scriptures. - Prepare sentences to use in your scheduled activities that apply these grammar principles. Practice speaking and writing the sentences. - Pay attention to word order in the language and to words and their parts. - Look for opportunities to practice and apply the grammar that you study each day. 5. Actively listen. Consider incorporating the following: - Listen carefully to native speakers. Imitate what you hear. - When you hear something you do not understand, write it down and find out what it means. Practice using the vocabulary or sentence pattern. - When listening, identify vocabulary and patterns that you have recently learned. - When you hear a phrase expressed differently from the way you would say it, write it down and practice it. However, as a servant of the Lord, always use appropriate language, not slang. - Make a list of things people might say to you during your planned activities. Look up words and phrases related to these responses. Plan and practice ways that you could respond. 6. Improve your ability to read and write. Read the Book of Mormon in your mission language to learn vocabulary and phrases and to practice grammar, pronunciation, and fluency. There is great power in using the scriptures in your language study. Also consider the following ideas: - Learn to read and write the alphabet, script, or characters of your language. For character-based writing systems, focus on reading skills, such as scripture reading, that will help you when you teach. - Read out loud from the Book of Mormon, other scriptures, or Church magazines in your mission language. Pay attention to unfamiliar vocabulary, phrases, and grammar. If you do not understand a word, try to understand its meaning from the context of the passage before you look it up. Add the word to your note cards. Use your native- language and mission-language scriptures side-by-side if necessary. - Have someone coach you on pronunciation, intonation, and pauses as you read. - Practice writing in your mission language—for example, personal notes and reminders, letters, thank-you notes, and notes of encouragement. Write your testimony in copies of the Book of Mormon that you distribute. 7. Ask others to help you. Consider incorporating the following ideas: - If your companion is a native speaker, take advantage of this great opportunity by asking questions frequently and seeking feedback. - Ask your companion and native speakers to correct you and to suggest ways to improve. If they use a word you don’t understand, ask them to define it for you. Children and grand- parents are often willing to help. - Invite those you teach to help you. Explain, “I’m learning your language. Please help me. If I struggle to find a word, please help me with it.” - Do not hesitate to ask for specific help: “How do you say ?” “How do you pronounce that?” Write down the answers and study them.']","Missionaries can effectively incorporate prayer for divine assistance and a language study plan to enhance their teaching and personal growth by following several key practices. Firstly, they should live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost and be obedient to the commandments and missionary standards, which includes praying sincerely for divine assistance. This spiritual foundation supports their efforts in learning and using the mission language daily. Secondly, creating a language study plan is crucial. This plan should include setting weekly and daily goals focused on improving communication and teaching abilities during scheduled activities. Missionaries should select appropriate language tools, such as dictionaries and grammar books, and memorize vocabulary and phrases relevant to their teaching. By actively listening to native speakers and practicing pronunciation, missionaries can improve their language skills. Additionally, they should seek help from companions, native speakers, and those they teach, asking for feedback and corrections. By combining sincere prayer with a structured language study plan, missionaries can better respond to the needs of investigators and the promptings of the Spirit, ultimately enhancing their effectiveness and personal growth."
How do conversion stories and spiritual knowledge contribute to the effectiveness of missionary work according to the Preach My Gospel manual?,"['<1-hop>\n\n## Ideas for Study and Application (page 28) ### Personal Study (Page 28) - Prepare a two-minute talk on one of the questions at the beginning of this chapter. Be prepared to share your talk with your companion or with other missionaries in a district meeting. - Ask recent converts to tell their conversion stories. What helped them gain “faith unto repentance” (Alma 34:17)? Why did they decide to be baptized and confirmed? What was it like for them to become new members of the Church? How could missionaries have served them better? - Consider what it means to raise the voice of warning (see Jacob 3:12; D&C 1:4; 38:41; 63:57–58; 88:81; 112:5; Ezekiel 3:17–21; 33:1–12). Write in your own words what it means and how you can go about doing it. - Read Mormon 8 and Moroni 1 and 10. As you read, ask yourself, “What was Moroni’s hope for our day? What did he want us to do with the Book of Mormon? What would I say to Moroni if I had the chance?” Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Consider the events in your life that have strengthened your testimony of Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Then write an answer to this question: What has helped you know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith? ### Companion Study (Page 28) - Share with each other your answers to the questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. - Share with each other what your hopes and desires were for your mission when you received your mission call. To what extent does your experience thus far meet your expectations? How can you meet these expectations more fully? - Read and discuss “Ministry” in the Bible Dictionary. - Select one of the following great missionaries, and read the references listed. As you read, discuss how this missionary (1) understood and committed himself to his calling, (2) demonstrated his attitude and desire for the work, and (3) helped others accept the gospel. - Alma (Mosiah 18) - Aaron (Alma 22; 23:1–6) - Nephi and Lehi (Helaman 5) - Peter (Acts 2) - Paul (Acts 16) - In the hymnbook, select two hymns under the topic “Restoration of the Gospel” (see page 424). Read or sing the hymns. Discuss the meaning of the words. - Read together “Faith,” “Repentance,” “Baptism,” and “Holy Ghost” in the Bible Dictionary. Read and discuss all the scripture references in each entry. - Read together “Dispensations” in the Bible Dictionary. Also read and discuss Doctrine and Covenants 136:37. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 29) - Invite two or three recent converts to share their conversion experiences. How did they feel about the missionaries? about what the missionaries taught? about keeping commitments? What most strongly influenced their conversion? - Invite a priesthood leader to talk to the missionaries about the opportunities and difficulties of building the Church in your area. - Read Alma 18 and discuss these questions: What were Lamoni’s feelings at the beginning of the story? How did they change? What feelings must a person have in order to receive the blessings of the gospel? Read Alma 34:15–16, and compare it with Lamoni’s story. How does Christ’s Atonement enable us to obtain mercy? - Discuss what it means to be a successful missionary. Invite missionaries to give specific examples of success. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Assign one group to read Acts 2:36–38 (Peter), another group to read Acts 16:25–33 (Paul), and the final group to read Mosiah 18:8–11 (Alma). Ask each group to answer the question, “What did this missionary do to help others increase in faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation?” Discuss what the missionaries learn from these stories that could help them exercise faith when inviting people to repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. - Several days before the meeting, assign several missionaries to ponder selected questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. Ask each missionary to prepare a two- to three-minute talk on his or her assigned question. During the district meeting or zone conference, allow the missionaries to give their talks. Following the talks, discuss what they learned and how they could use it in their missionary work. - Divide the missionaries into four groups. Ask each group to list as many truths, covenants, and ordinances as they can that were restored and revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Have each group share their results. Invite missionaries to share how any of the truths revealed through the Restoration has influenced their lives. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 29) 1. During interviews, periodically ask missionaries to share with you: – Their testimony of Jesus Christ. – Their testimony of the restored gospel and the mission of Joseph Smith. – Their testimony of the Book of Mormon. – Their thoughts about their purpose as a missionary. 2. Invite missionaries to record in their study journal what they feel is the purpose of their mission. During an interview, ask them to share what they have written. 3. Send a letter of congratulations to new members. > Beginning of Chapter 2 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach? (Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns.']","Conversion stories and spiritual knowledge are integral to effective missionary work as outlined in the Preach My Gospel manual. Conversion stories, as shared by recent converts, provide insights into what helped them gain faith unto repentance and why they decided to be baptized and confirmed. These stories can highlight the role of missionaries and how they could have served better, offering valuable lessons for current missionaries. Spiritual knowledge, on the other hand, is emphasized as essential for teaching effectively. Missionaries are encouraged to develop a habit of gospel study, which is an act of faith and requires personal agency. This study helps missionaries grow in the gospel and stay on the path to eternal life, ultimately aiding those they teach to grow in their faith in the Savior. Thus, both conversion stories and spiritual knowledge are crucial for missionaries to understand their purpose and improve their teaching methods."
How do prayer and the Book of Mormon contribute to the missionary work and conversion process according to the guidance provided in the missionary training context?,"['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 115) - Talk about the prayers you offer as companions. Are they guided by the Holy Ghost? Have you received answers to your prayers? When you pray as companions, do you: – Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness? – Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers? – Pray for people by name and consider their needs? – Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you? – Receive answers to your prayers? - Discuss as companions how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly. - Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost. Write comments that investigators have made about their experiences with the Spirit in learning the gospel and trying to keep commitments. How can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 116) - Occasionally ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you. - In interviews, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers.

(Page 117) #### Consider This - How is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion? - How does the Book of Mormon answer the great questions of the soul? - Why is the Book of Mormon so powerful in the conversion process? - How should I use the Book of Mormon to build faith and help others to draw closer to God? - Why is the promise in Moroni 10:3–5 central in missionary work? ## Overview (Page 117) The Book of Mormon is powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion (Page 117) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (History of the Church, 2:52). An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge- shaped pieces that lean against each other. The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways: - Witness of Christ. “The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.” - Fulness of doctrine. “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (D&C 20:9 [;27:5].) . . . In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation. And they are taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.” - Foundation of testimony. “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” (A Witness and a Warning [1988], 18–19). The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach investigators. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach investigators. | Missionary Lesson | Doctrines | References | | --- | --- | --- | | The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ | Apostasy, Restoration, Joseph Smith, priesthood authority | 1 Nephi 12-14 2 Nephi 3; 26-29 Mosiah 18 | | The Plan of Salvation | The “great plan of the eternal God,” including the Fall of Adam, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the Judgment | 2 Nephi 2; 9 Mosiah 3; 15 Alma 12; 40-42 | | The Gospel of Jesus Christ | Faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end | 2 Nephi 31-32 3 Nephi 11; 27 | | The Commandments; Laws and Ordinances | Ordinances such as baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament | 3 Nephi 11:22-28; 18 Moroni 2-6 |']","Prayer and the Book of Mormon play crucial roles in missionary work and the conversion process. Prayer, as discussed in the context, is a means for missionaries to seek divine guidance, express gratitude, and influence their daily planning and activities. It is emphasized that prayers should be sincere and guided by the Holy Ghost, and that missionaries should pray for others by name and consider their needs. The Book of Mormon, on the other hand, is described as the keystone of the religion, providing a powerful witness of Christ and containing the fulness of the gospel. It is essential for conversion, as it is believed that the Holy Ghost will testify of its truth to those who read and ponder it with a sincere heart. Together, prayer and the Book of Mormon are foundational in building faith and helping others draw closer to God, making them central to the missionary's teaching and conversion efforts."
How does scripture study enhance understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ according to the teachings in the Book of Mormon?,"['<1-hop>\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 19) The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work. The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will, and His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 20) What is the gospel, or doctrine, of Christ? - Read 2 Nephi 31:10–21, 3 Nephi 11:31–41, 3 Nephi 27:13–22 for answers to the question. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion (Page 117) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (introduction to the Book of Mormon).

What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for yourself and for others. - Rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Be exactly obedient. • Study the language of your mission each day. - Plan every day and focus on the key indicators. - Work effectively all day, every day. - Ask for referrals from everyone! - Teach when you find; find when you teach. - Read the Book of Mormon with those you teach. - Teach people that an important way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. - Contact every investigator daily. - Bear testimony frequently. - Have a member at every lesson possible. - Always set specific dates and times for the next lesson. - Invite all investigators to baptismal services. - After each lesson, provide investigators with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. - Build relationships with members by serving them and working with the leadership of the ward. - Help ward leaders with retention and activation activities. - Help everyone you teach make commitments that will bring about repentance and will strengthen their faith in the Savior. - Love the Lord and serve Him the very best you can.', '<3-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 115) - Talk about the prayers you offer as companions. Are they guided by the Holy Ghost? Have you received answers to your prayers? When you pray as companions, do you: – Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness? – Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers? – Pray for people by name and consider their needs? – Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you? – Receive answers to your prayers? - Discuss as companions how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly. - Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost. Write comments that investigators have made about their experiences with the Spirit in learning the gospel and trying to keep commitments. How can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ###', '<4-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 116) - Occasionally ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you. - In interviews, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers. Ask them if they feel their prayers are meaningful. - Ask missionaries how they help investigators feel and recognize the Spirit. - As appropriate, relate to missionaries how you receive revelation on transfers, missionaries who are disobedient or need help, and doctrines to teach. > Beginning of Chapter 5 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon? (Page 117) #### Consider This - How is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion? - How does the Book of Mormon answer the great questions of the soul? - Why is the Book of Mormon so powerful in the conversion process? - How should I use the Book of Mormon to build faith and help others to draw closer to God? - Why is the promise in Moroni 10:3–5 central in missionary work? ## Overview (Page 117) The Book of Mormon is powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching. ##']","Missionaries can effectively support less-active members and new converts in building their faith in Jesus Christ and engaging in missionary work by following several strategies outlined in the context. First, they should work closely with local priesthood leaders to ensure new converts are ordained to the priesthood, receive home teachers, and prepare the name of an ancestor for temple work, as mentioned in the 'Mission President' section on Page 237. Additionally, missionaries are encouraged to invite recent converts to share their experiences and testimonies, which can inspire both the missionaries and the converts themselves. Furthermore, missionaries should focus on teaching the 'Laws and Ordinances' lesson with home teachers present, as this can reinforce the importance of gospel principles and sacred ordinances. In the 'Companion Study' section on Page 236, it is suggested that missionaries visit less-active members to build their faith in Jesus Christ and ask for referrals, which can help in reactivating them and involving them in missionary work. By following these guidelines, missionaries can help less-active members and new converts regain their 'desire and purpose' to live the gospel and participate in missionary efforts."
How does faith in Jesus Christ and prayer play a role in the process of repentance and receiving the Holy Ghost according to the teachings provided?,"['<1-hop>\n\nWe do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven. - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - Faith in Jesus Christ - Repentance - Baptism, Our First Covenant - The Gift of the Holy Ghost - Endure to the End **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)? Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMedium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 81) Our message is one of faith and hope. We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 84) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - What does it mean to repent? - Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost an essential part of the gospel? - Why is it important for you to be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?', '<3-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##']","Faith in Jesus Christ is the foundational principle that leads individuals to repent, which involves stopping wrong actions and continuing right ones. This faith also motivates individuals to keep His commandments, including baptism, which is followed by the promise of receiving the Holy Ghost. Prayer is essential in this process as it is a means of communicating with Heavenly Father to seek confirmation of the truth of the gospel, including the teachings of the Book of Mormon. Through prayer, individuals can receive guidance and confirmation from the Holy Ghost, which teaches truth through feelings and thoughts. This divine guidance helps individuals to repent and prepare for baptism, ultimately leading to the reception of the Holy Ghost, which provides comfort, guidance, and a confirmation of truth."
How does personal study contribute to strengthening a missionary's testimony of Jesus Christ and the restored gospel?,"['<1-hop>\n\n## Ideas for Study and Application (page 28) ### Personal Study (Page 28) - Prepare a two-minute talk on one of the questions at the beginning of this chapter. Be prepared to share your talk with your companion or with other missionaries in a district meeting. - Ask recent converts to tell their conversion stories. What helped them gain “faith unto repentance” (Alma 34:17)? Why did they decide to be baptized and confirmed? What was it like for them to become new members of the Church? How could missionaries have served them better? - Consider what it means to raise the voice of warning (see Jacob 3:12; D&C 1:4; 38:41; 63:57–58; 88:81; 112:5; Ezekiel 3:17–21; 33:1–12). Write in your own words what it means and how you can go about doing it. - Read Mormon 8 and Moroni 1 and 10. As you read, ask yourself, “What was Moroni’s hope for our day? What did he want us to do with the Book of Mormon? What would I say to Moroni if I had the chance?” Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Consider the events in your life that have strengthened your testimony of Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Then write an answer to this question: What has helped you know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith? ### Companion Study (Page 28) - Share with each other your answers to the questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. - Share with each other what your hopes and desires were for your mission when you received your mission call. To what extent does your experience thus far meet your expectations? How can you meet these expectations more fully? - Read and discuss “Ministry” in the Bible Dictionary. - Select one of the following great missionaries, and read the references listed. As you read, discuss how this missionary (1) understood and committed himself to his calling, (2) demonstrated his attitude and desire for the work, and (3) helped others accept the gospel. - Alma (Mosiah 18) - Aaron (Alma 22; 23:1–6) - Nephi and Lehi (Helaman 5) - Peter (Acts 2) - Paul (Acts 16) - In the hymnbook, select two hymns under the topic “Restoration of the Gospel” (see page 424). Read or sing the hymns. Discuss the meaning of the words. - Read together “Faith,” “Repentance,” “Baptism,” and “Holy Ghost” in the Bible Dictionary. Read and discuss all the scripture references in each entry. - Read together “Dispensations” in the Bible Dictionary. Also read and discuss Doctrine and Covenants 136:37. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 29) - Invite two or three recent converts to share their conversion experiences. How did they feel about the missionaries? about what the missionaries taught? about keeping commitments? What most strongly influenced their conversion? - Invite a priesthood leader to talk to the missionaries about the opportunities and difficulties of building the Church in your area. - Read Alma 18 and discuss these questions: What were Lamoni’s feelings at the beginning of the story? How did they change? What feelings must a person have in order to receive the blessings of the gospel? Read Alma 34:15–16, and compare it with Lamoni’s story. How does Christ’s Atonement enable us to obtain mercy? - Discuss what it means to be a successful missionary. Invite missionaries to give specific examples of success. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Assign one group to read Acts 2:36–38 (Peter), another group to read Acts 16:25–33 (Paul), and the final group to read Mosiah 18:8–11 (Alma). Ask each group to answer the question, “What did this missionary do to help others increase in faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation?” Discuss what the missionaries learn from these stories that could help them exercise faith when inviting people to repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. - Several days before the meeting, assign several missionaries to ponder selected questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. Ask each missionary to prepare a two- to three-minute talk on his or her assigned question. During the district meeting or zone conference, allow the missionaries to give their talks. Following the talks, discuss what they learned and how they could use it in their missionary work. - Divide the missionaries into four groups. Ask each group to list as many truths, covenants, and ordinances as they can that were restored and revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Have each group share their results. Invite missionaries to share how any of the truths revealed through the Restoration has influenced their lives. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 29) 1.

(Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns.', '<3-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 138) ### Personal Study (Page 138) - Prepare a five-minute talk on one of the attributes discussed in this chapter. - Using the Topical Guide, look for ways the Savior has exemplified the attributes described in this chapter. Record what you learn in your study journal. - Periodically complete the “Attribute Activity” at the end of this chapter. - Identify an attribute in this chapter. Ask yourself: - How can I develop this attribute? - What must change in my heart, mind, and actions to develop this attribute? - How will keeping covenants help me develop this attribute? - How will developing this attribute help me qualify for the Holy Spirit and become a more powerful minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - Find examples of Christlike attributes in the lives of men and women in the scriptures. Record your impressions in your study journal. ### Companion Study (Page 138) - Study references to Christlike attributes in the missionary library. - Discuss relationships among different attributes. For example: - How does faith relate to diligence? - In what ways are humility and love related? - How does knowledge strengthen patience? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 138) - Several days before district meeting or zone conference, ask each missionary to select one of the attributes in this chapter or in the scriptures and prepare a five- minute talk on that attribute, including scriptures that have helped him or her. Allow time in the meeting for a few missionaries to share their talks. - Divide the missionaries into three groups, and give them the following assignment: Group 1: Read 1 Nephi 17:7–16 and answer the following questions: - How did Nephi exercise his faith? - What did Nephi do that was Christlike? - What promises did the Lord make to Nephi if he would be faithful and keep the commandments? - How does this account apply to missionary work? Group 2: Read Jacob 7:1–15 and answer the following questions: - Why was Jacob’s faith strong enough to resist Sherem’s attack? - How did Jacob exercise faith when he talked with Sherem? - How were Jacob’s actions Christlike? - What can we do to develop faith like Jacob’s? Group 3: Read Joseph Smith—History 1:8–18, and answer the following questions: - In what ways did Joseph Smith exercise faith in Jesus Christ? - How was his faith tried? - What did he do that was Christlike? - What can we do to follow Joseph Smith’s example? After the groups finish, bring the missionaries together and ask them to share what they discussed. - Share an experience of when you were blessed or inspired by another person’s faith. - Have missionaries refer to the “Attribute Activity. - Page 140” Give each missionary a piece of paper on which to write his or her answers. - When they have completed the worksheet, invite them to set personal goals. - Ask a few of the missionaries to share what they learned and felt as they completed the worksheet. - Share your testimony concerning the importance of developing Christlike attributes. ### Mission President (Page 139) - Ask missionaries to read one of the four Gospels in the New Testament or 3 Nephi 11–28. Have them underline what the Savior did that they can also do. - Use goal setting and planning to teach missionaries about diligence. Show how diligence in focusing on people is an expression of love. - During interviews, ask missionaries to talk about an attribute they are trying to develop. - In a zone conference, invite missionaries to tell about Christlike attributes they admire in their companions. > Beginning of chapter 7 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual #']","Personal study plays a crucial role in strengthening a missionary's testimony of Jesus Christ and the restored gospel. According to the context, missionaries are encouraged to engage in personal study by preparing talks, reflecting on conversion stories, and considering the events that have strengthened their testimony of Joseph Smith and the Restoration. This process helps them articulate their beliefs and understand the significance of gospel principles. Additionally, missionaries are advised to record their thoughts and feelings in a study journal, which aids in internalizing their testimony. The mission president also emphasizes the importance of missionaries sharing their testimony of Jesus Christ, the restored gospel, and the mission of Joseph Smith during interviews, further reinforcing their faith through personal reflection and expression."
How does understanding doctrine and defining words improve effective communication in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nStudying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain the baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). ####', '<2-hop>\n\nDefining Words (Page 35) We have a powerful message with a unique vocabulary. Just as a physician speaks differently in the family waiting room than in the operating room, so too must you learn to speak so that those who are unfamiliar with our message can understand what you are teaching. To prepare to help others understand unfamiliar words, study the list of key definitions and terms in the ”Ideas for Teaching“ section of each lesson. Become familiar with the definitions provided. Use True to the Faith and the Bible Dictionary to find definitions for other words. Write these definitions in your study journal. Share the definitions with your companion and others to see if you understand. If the definitions are unclear to others, revise your definitions based on the material you have studied. As you teach, seek to discern whether a word or principle is new to the person you are teaching. Take time to explain unfamiliar words or principles. Remember to teach for understanding so that you and those you teach “are edified and rejoice together” (D&C 50:22). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 35) Turn to the lesson “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ” located in chapter 3. Read the list of key definitions in the “Ideas for Teaching” section. Locate three other words in the lesson that you would like to define. Follow the suggestions given above in creating a definition for each. ## Study Ideas and Suggestions (Page 36) Each of the ideas and suggestions in this section can make your study time more rewarding and spiritually uplifting. Consider the following as you plan your study: - Always begin with a prayer. - Plan study activities that will build your faith in the Savior and use your time productively. - Plan your study around people, their needs, and preparing them for baptism, confirmation, and enduring to the end. Note your study plans in your daily planner. - Plan your study by asking: What will I be teaching today? How can I plan my study to best help those I teach? Which ideas and suggestions from this section will I incorporate in my study? As you plan your study activities, experiment with some of the ideas and suggestions that follow or with additional ideas you learn from others. ### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals.']","Understanding doctrine and defining words improve effective communication in missionary work by ensuring that missionaries can teach with clarity and spiritual power. By thoroughly understanding the doctrine, missionaries can build their testimony and teach with conviction, helping others strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ and make commitments. Additionally, by defining words and using a vocabulary that is understandable to those unfamiliar with the message, missionaries can ensure that their teachings are clear and comprehensible. This approach helps both the missionary and those they teach to be 'edified and rejoice together,' as it allows for a deeper understanding and application of the gospel principles."
How does faith in Jesus Christ and prayer contribute to personal growth and spiritual insights according to the teachings in the Book of Mormon?,"['<1-hop>\n\nWe do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven. - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - Faith in Jesus Christ - Repentance - Baptism, Our First Covenant - The Gift of the Holy Ghost - Endure to the End **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 84) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - What does it mean to repent? - Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost an essential part of the gospel? - Why is it important for you to be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?', '<3-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##', '<4-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Answers Questions of the Soul (Page 121) President Ezra Taft Benson said that missionaries “need to show how [the Book of Mormon] answers the great questions of the soul” (“Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, Nov. 1988, 5). “The great questions of the soul” may include such questions as these: Is there really a God? Did I exist before I was born? Will I live after I die? What is the purpose of life? Is Jesus really the Savior? Other questions may focus on more temporal needs: How can I improve my relationship with my spouse? How can I help my teenagers avoid drugs or immorality? How can I find work to support my family? The gospel of Jesus Christ helps us answer both kinds of questions. As we gain faith that the Book of Mormon is true, we can begin to answer questions about the purpose of life and the hope of eternal life. The Book of Mormon describes the plan of happiness, which gives meaning and perspective to life. Answers to questions such as the following are clearly taught in the Book of Mormon. - Is there a God? (Alma 22) - What does Jesus Christ expect of me? (2 Nephi 9) - How can a belief in Jesus Christ help me? (Alma 36) - Is there life after death? (Alma 40) - What is the purpose of life? (Alma 34) - Why does God allow evil and suffering to occur? (2 Nephi 2; Alma 14:9–11; 60:13) - Does my infant need to be baptized? (Moroni 8) - Does God know me? (Alma 5:38, 58) - Does God answer prayers? (Enos 1) - How can I find peace and joy? (Mosiah 2, 4) - How can my family be happier and more united? (Mosiah 2) - How can I balance my family and career? (3 Nephi 13) - How can I strengthen my relationship with my spouse? (3 Nephi 14) - How can I avoid the evils that threaten my family? (Alma 39) - How can I avoid sin? (Helaman 5) As we read the Book of Mormon with the guidance of the Spirit, it helps us answer personal questions. It teaches that prayer and revelation are the key to solving particular problems. It helps us have faith that God will answer our prayers. The Book of Mormon also helps us understand that God’s commandments are not a restrictive list of dos and don’ts but guideposts to a happy, abundant life. As we begin to understand that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are the way to the abundant life, we will appreciate that these principles help answer any question and fill any need. For example, we understand that repentance, forgiveness, and the covenant to serve others are essential in improving relationships with our spouses. We see that faith in Christ, accepting and keeping covenants, and following the promptings of the Spirit can help teenagers avoid the powerful temptations that surround them. The gospel can resolve almost any question or need. This is why you are to “teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel” (D&C 42:12). “In a world ever more dangerous . . . the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ has the nourishing power to heal starving spirits of the world. – PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER “THE BOOK OF MORMON: ANOTHER TESTAMENT OF JESUS CHRIST,” ENSIGN, NOV. 2001, 64 #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 122) Make a list of some “great questions of the soul” that investigators have asked. Find verses in the Book of Mormon to answer these questions. Write the answers in your study journal, and use them as you teach. ##', '<5-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Draws People Nearer to God (Page 122) Regarding the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). The Book of Mormon is a springboard to testimony and personal revelation. Use the Book of Mormon to help people have spiritual experiences, especially a witness from the Holy Ghost that the book itself is true. By consistently inviting people to live the principles found in the Book of Mormon, you help them develop faith in Jesus Christ and draw nearer to God. President Gordon B. Hinckley declared: “Those who have read [the Book of Mormon] prayerfully, be they rich or poor, learned or unlearned, have grown under its power. . . . Without reservation I promise you that if you will prayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts . . . the Spirit of the Lord. There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“The Power of the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, June 1988, 6). ## Use the Book of Mormon to Respond to Objections (Page 122) Many people will not believe everything you teach. President Ezra Taft Benson taught how the Book of Mormon can be the central resource in responding to such situations: “We are to use the Book of Mormon in handling objections to the Church. . . . “. . . All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. . . . The only problem the objector has to resolve forhimself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation. “Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively. We are not obligated to answer every objection. Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand” (A Witness and a Warning, 4–5). For example, sincere investigators might object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom. Help them see that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation. You might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.” Investigators must resolve for themselves their concerns and objections. You can help as you focus them on what will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. When they strengthen their testimony of the Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections and concerns. As you answer concerns, remember that our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his successors—who receive direct revelation from God. There- fore, the first question for an investigator to answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon.']","Faith in Jesus Christ and prayer are central to personal growth and spiritual insights as taught in the Book of Mormon. Faith in Christ is the foundation of the gospel, leading individuals to repent, keep commandments, and receive the Holy Ghost, which guides and comforts them. Prayer is a means of communication with God, allowing individuals to express gratitude, seek guidance, and confirm the truth of the Book of Mormon. Through prayer, individuals can receive answers and spiritual truths from the Holy Ghost, which are often gentle and quiet feelings that confirm the teachings of the gospel. This process of exercising faith and engaging in sincere prayer helps individuals draw nearer to God, develop Christlike attributes, and gain a testimony of the gospel's truth, ultimately contributing to their personal growth and spiritual insights."
How does missionary work relate to the importance of family in the context of the Restoration of the gospel?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIn many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to . . .""* If a little more time is available, you might say more: *""Our message is simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nAddressing the Importance of the Family (Page 173) The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity. Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following: *There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity. Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.* You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration: *The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrines and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about . . .* The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Importance of Members (Page 174) Work with members of the Church to find people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to investigate the restored gospel. This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and less-active members, recent converts, and part-member families. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting. Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better way. That way is through the members of the Church. Whenever there is a member who introduces an investigator, there is an immediate support system. The member bears testimony of the truth of the work. He is anxious for the happiness of his investigator friend. He becomes excited as that friend makes progress in learning the gospel. “The full-time missionaries may do the actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up that teaching with the offering of his home to carry on this missionary service. He will bear sincere testimony of the divinity of the work. He will be there to answer questions when the missionaries are not around. He will be a friend to the convert who is making a big and often difficult change. . . . The process of bringing new people into the Church is not the responsibility alone of the missionaries. They succeed best when members become the source from which new investigators are found” (Ensign, May 1999, 105–6). The starting point in building strong relationships with members is the bishop. Offer to help and serve in any righteous way that he asks. Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing or a burden to the bishop?” Develop a “How can I help?” attitude. If you will look for opportunities to love, serve, and teach, the bishop and ward members will be more likely to trust you with their family members and friends. “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.” – THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH TEACHINGS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH, 113. Consider the following excerpt from a letter written by a missionary to his mission president: *Dear President, The assistants called today telling me I’m being transferred. I felt that I should write and thank you for sending me to this area. It seems like it was just yesterday that you were telling me about the challenges that lay ahead. Our first Sunday confirmed what you told me. We received a lukewarm welcome to the ward. The only ray of light that first Sunday was Scott, the new ward mission leader. He had been transferred to the Air Force base a month earlier and had been serving as ward mission leader for two weeks. Scott invited us to his home for dinner our first Sunday to discuss what could be done to get the work moving. After dinner, we knelt in prayer and asked Heavenly Father for His direction. As we prayed, we felt a sense of peace and determination. We determined that the best way to move the work forward was to gain the trust of the members. We decided to follow Ammon’s example and serve them. We started with the bishop. Because of the lack of baptisms in the area and the lack of effort from the previous missionaries, he was understandably less than excited at our request to meet with him. He eventually invited us over to his home for dinner. We learned that the bishop was preparing to remove the carpet from his living room and restore the hardwood floor found underneath.']","Missionary work is closely related to the importance of family in the context of the Restoration of the gospel. The Restoration message emphasizes that families are central to God's plan, as they provide a sense of belonging, identity, and love. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families can be strengthened and experience peace and joy. Missionaries are encouraged to connect the message of the Restoration to the natural interest people have in families, highlighting that families can live together eternally and that the restored truths help in achieving strong, happy families. This approach not only helps in finding people to teach but also underscores the eternal significance of family relationships as part of God's family."
How can missionaries effectively incorporate the importance of family into their teaching to enhance missionary work and connect it to the Restoration of the gospel?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIn many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to . . .""* If a little more time is available, you might say more: *""Our message is simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nAddressing the Importance of the Family (Page 173) The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity. Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following: *There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity. Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.* You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration: *The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrines and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about . . .* The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Importance of Members (Page 174) Work with members of the Church to find people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to investigate the restored gospel. This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and less-active members, recent converts, and part-member families. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting. Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better way. That way is through the members of the Church. Whenever there is a member who introduces an investigator, there is an immediate support system. The member bears testimony of the truth of the work. He is anxious for the happiness of his investigator friend. He becomes excited as that friend makes progress in learning the gospel. “The full-time missionaries may do the actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up that teaching with the offering of his home to carry on this missionary service. He will bear sincere testimony of the divinity of the work. He will be there to answer questions when the missionaries are not around. He will be a friend to the convert who is making a big and often difficult change. . . . The process of bringing new people into the Church is not the responsibility alone of the missionaries. They succeed best when members become the source from which new investigators are found” (Ensign, May 1999, 105–6). The starting point in building strong relationships with members is the bishop. Offer to help and serve in any righteous way that he asks. Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing or a burden to the bishop?” Develop a “How can I help?” attitude. If you will look for opportunities to love, serve, and teach, the bishop and ward members will be more likely to trust you with their family members and friends. “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.” – THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH TEACHINGS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH, 113. Consider the following excerpt from a letter written by a missionary to his mission president: *Dear President, The assistants called today telling me I’m being transferred. I felt that I should write and thank you for sending me to this area. It seems like it was just yesterday that you were telling me about the challenges that lay ahead. Our first Sunday confirmed what you told me. We received a lukewarm welcome to the ward. The only ray of light that first Sunday was Scott, the new ward mission leader. He had been transferred to the Air Force base a month earlier and had been serving as ward mission leader for two weeks. Scott invited us to his home for dinner our first Sunday to discuss what could be done to get the work moving. After dinner, we knelt in prayer and asked Heavenly Father for His direction. As we prayed, we felt a sense of peace and determination. We determined that the best way to move the work forward was to gain the trust of the members. We decided to follow Ammon’s example and serve them. We started with the bishop. Because of the lack of baptisms in the area and the lack of effort from the previous missionaries, he was understandably less than excited at our request to meet with him. He eventually invited us over to his home for dinner. We learned that the bishop was preparing to remove the carpet from his living room and restore the hardwood floor found underneath.', '<4-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for yourself and for others. - Rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Be exactly obedient. • Study the language of your mission each day. - Plan every day and focus on the key indicators. - Work effectively all day, every day. - Ask for referrals from everyone! - Teach when you find; find when you teach. - Read the Book of Mormon with those you teach. - Teach people that an important way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. - Contact every investigator daily. - Bear testimony frequently. - Have a member at every lesson possible. - Always set specific dates and times for the next lesson. - Invite all investigators to baptismal services. - After each lesson, provide investigators with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. - Build relationships with members by serving them and working with the leadership of the ward. - Help ward leaders with retention and activation activities. - Help everyone you teach make commitments that will bring about repentance and will strengthen their faith in the Savior. - Love the Lord and serve Him the very best you can.']","Missionaries can effectively incorporate the importance of family into their teaching by relating the universal interest in families to the message of the Restoration. They can emphasize that families are central to God's plan and that the restored gospel strengthens families, providing peace, joy, and a sense of belonging. By highlighting that family ties are eternal and rooted in our relationship with God, missionaries can transition to discussing the Restoration, explaining that true doctrines and ordinances have been restored to help families live together after this life. This approach not only resonates with people's natural interest in family but also connects them to the unique message of the Restoration, thereby enhancing missionary work."
How does scripture study enhance the ability to teach by the Spirit according to the missionary guidelines?,"['<1-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nStudying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain the baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). ####', '<3-hop>\n\n#### Activity: Personal Study (Page 32) Read Joseph Smith—History 1:11–13. Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.” – PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER “LITTLE CHILDREN,” ENSIGN, NOV. 1986, 17 ####', '<4-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question.']","Scripture study enhances the ability to teach by the Spirit by providing a solid understanding of the doctrine, which is essential for effective teaching. According to the missionary guidelines, studying the scriptures helps missionaries to seek and follow the Spirit as they prepare and teach lessons. It allows them to treasure up and apply the doctrines in their lives, which in turn builds their testimony and ability to teach with spiritual power. The guidelines emphasize that teaching by the Spirit involves organizing and summarizing the doctrine clearly, focusing on the needs of those being taught, and preparing to answer questions. By engaging in scripture study, missionaries are better equipped to teach with clarity and conviction, bear testimony frequently, and help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ."
How does faith in Jesus Christ and prayer contribute to personal growth and spiritual insights according to the teachings in the missionary study journals?,"['<1-hop>\n\nWe do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven. - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - Faith in Jesus Christ - Repentance - Baptism, Our First Covenant - The Gift of the Holy Ghost - Endure to the End **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 84) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - What does it mean to repent? - Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost an essential part of the gospel? - Why is it important for you to be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?', '<3-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##', '<4-hop>\n\n#### Activity: Personal Study (Page 32) Read Joseph Smith—History 1:11–13. Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.” – PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER “LITTLE CHILDREN,” ENSIGN, NOV. 1986, 17 ####']","Faith in Jesus Christ is foundational to personal growth and spiritual insights as it leads individuals to repent, make commitments, and follow the Spirit, as described in the missionary study journals. This faith is the beginning of living the gospel, which includes repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost, ultimately guiding individuals to eternal life. Prayer plays a crucial role in this process by allowing individuals to communicate with Heavenly Father, express gratitude, seek confirmation of spiritual truths, and receive guidance through the Holy Ghost. The journals emphasize that through prayer, individuals can know the truth of the Book of Mormon and the Restoration, which strengthens their faith and desire to live according to the gospel. This combination of faith and prayer helps individuals grow in Christlike attributes, endure to the end, and qualify for eternal life, as they are continually cleansed from sin and guided by the Holy Ghost."
How can missionaries effectively apply personal learning to improve their language skills during their mission?,"['<1-hop>\n\n### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ###', '<2-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching. Practice summarizing them in your own words. - Review the ideas in this chapter. Discuss which suggestions you could use in companion study during the next week. - If you are training a new missionary, take note of situations when your companion is not understood. Make a list of relevant words, phrases, or grammar that would help your companion. Explain and practice how to use what is on the list in upcoming, planned activities. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 148) - Invite native speakers to the meeting. Arrange for the missionaries to teach them in small groups. Ask the native speakers to take notes and give feedback on the missionaries’ language. - Assign one or two missionaries ahead of time to tell about successes they have had in studying the language. Have them share their ideas. - Assign an experienced missionary to present briefly some part of the language that is usually difficult for missionaries. Present examples of good usage, and have the missionaries practice them. - Have missionaries who are native to the culture share helpful insights. ### Mission President (Page 149) - Periodically interview missionaries in the language they are learning. - Ask local priesthood leaders for ideas on how missionaries can improve their language. - Identify the most common mistakes made by missionaries learning your mission language. Give instruction in zone conference on correcting these mistakes. - Teach missionaries the doctrine of spiritual gifts. - Observe your missionaries when they teach in the language. - Look for opportunities to use the language with your missionaries. > Beginning of chapter 7 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Use Time Wisely? (Page 151) #### Consider This (Page 151) - How can goals help me be a more effective missionary? - What should be the focus of my goals? - What are my planning tools and resources, and how do I use them? - Why is the area book important? - How do I conduct weekly and daily planning sessions? - How will I know if my goals and plans are helping to further the Lord’s work? ## Overview (Page 151) You are assigned to do the Lord’s work in a specific area. He wants you to watch over your area with love and great care. Your purpose is to help others come unto Him through baptism and confirmation. Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it. Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you. As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders. Your missionary call letter states: “You will also be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs. As you do these things the Lord will bless you and you will become an effective advocate and messenger of the truth. We place in you our confidence and pray that the Lord will help you meet your responsibilities in fulfilling this sacred assignment.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study Read Jacob 5:11–13, 61–64, 74–75, and answer these questions: - How does the Lord feel about His children? - What kind of effort does the Lord require of His servants? ##']","Missionaries can effectively apply personal learning to improve their language skills by integrating personal application of learning with missionary language learning strategies. They are encouraged to 'liken' what they learn to themselves, set goals to live what they are learning, and personalize scripture study by substituting their name in verses. This personal application can be extended to language learning by practicing teaching each other the missionary lessons in their mission language, asking companions for feedback on pronunciation, and summarizing scripture stories in their own words. Additionally, missionaries can benefit from district meetings and zone conferences where native speakers provide feedback, and experienced missionaries share language learning successes and challenges. By combining these personal and collaborative study methods, missionaries can enhance both their spiritual insights and language proficiency."
How can missionaries effectively incorporate the importance of family into their teaching to enhance the impact of their message about the Restoration of the gospel?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIn many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to . . .""* If a little more time is available, you might say more: *""Our message is simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nAddressing the Importance of the Family (Page 173) The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity. Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following: *There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity. Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.* You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration: *The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrines and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about . . .* The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Importance of Members (Page 174) Work with members of the Church to find people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to investigate the restored gospel. This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and less-active members, recent converts, and part-member families. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting. Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better way. That way is through the members of the Church. Whenever there is a member who introduces an investigator, there is an immediate support system. The member bears testimony of the truth of the work. He is anxious for the happiness of his investigator friend. He becomes excited as that friend makes progress in learning the gospel. “The full-time missionaries may do the actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up that teaching with the offering of his home to carry on this missionary service. He will bear sincere testimony of the divinity of the work. He will be there to answer questions when the missionaries are not around. He will be a friend to the convert who is making a big and often difficult change. . . . The process of bringing new people into the Church is not the responsibility alone of the missionaries. They succeed best when members become the source from which new investigators are found” (Ensign, May 1999, 105–6). The starting point in building strong relationships with members is the bishop. Offer to help and serve in any righteous way that he asks. Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing or a burden to the bishop?” Develop a “How can I help?” attitude. If you will look for opportunities to love, serve, and teach, the bishop and ward members will be more likely to trust you with their family members and friends. “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.” – THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH TEACHINGS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH, 113. Consider the following excerpt from a letter written by a missionary to his mission president: *Dear President, The assistants called today telling me I’m being transferred. I felt that I should write and thank you for sending me to this area. It seems like it was just yesterday that you were telling me about the challenges that lay ahead. Our first Sunday confirmed what you told me. We received a lukewarm welcome to the ward. The only ray of light that first Sunday was Scott, the new ward mission leader. He had been transferred to the Air Force base a month earlier and had been serving as ward mission leader for two weeks. Scott invited us to his home for dinner our first Sunday to discuss what could be done to get the work moving. After dinner, we knelt in prayer and asked Heavenly Father for His direction. As we prayed, we felt a sense of peace and determination. We determined that the best way to move the work forward was to gain the trust of the members. We decided to follow Ammon’s example and serve them. We started with the bishop. Because of the lack of baptisms in the area and the lack of effort from the previous missionaries, he was understandably less than excited at our request to meet with him. He eventually invited us over to his home for dinner. We learned that the bishop was preparing to remove the carpet from his living room and restore the hardwood floor found underneath.', '<4-hop>\n\n## A Successful Missionary (Page 24) Your success as a missionary is measured primarily by your commitment to find, teach, baptize, and confirm people and to help them become faithful members of the Church who enjoy the presence of the Holy Ghost. Avoid comparing yourself to other missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts against theirs. Remember that people have agency to choose whether to accept your message. Your responsibility is to teach clearly and powerfully so they can make a correct choice. Some may not accept your message even when they have received a spiritual witness that it is true. You will be saddened because you love them and desire their salvation. You should not, however, become discouraged; discouragement will weaken your faith. If you lower your expectations, your effectiveness will decrease, your desire will weaken, and you will have greater difficulty following the Spirit. You can know you have been a successful missionary when you: - Feel the Spirit testify to people through you. - Love people and desire their salvation. - Obey with exactness. - Live so that you can receive and know how to follow the Spirit, who will show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Develop Christlike attributes. - Work effectively every day, do your very best to bring souls to Christ, and seek earnestly to learn and improve. - Help build up the Church (the ward) wherever you are assigned to work. - Warn people of the consequences of sin. Invite them to make and keep commitments. - Teach and serve other missionaries. - Go about doing good and serving people at every opportunity, whether or not they accept your message. When you have done your very best, you may still experience disappointments, but you will not be disappointed in yourself. You can feel certain that the Lord is pleased when you feel the Spirit working through you. #### Scripture Study (Page 25) How do servants of the Lord feel about the work? How do servants of the Lord influence those they serve? - Read Mosiah 28:3, Alma 8:14–15, Helaman 10:3–5, 3 Nephi 28:4–10, Ether 12:13–15, D&C 15:4–6, D&C 16:4–6 and D&C 68:2–6 for the answers to the questions. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 25) - Read Helaman 10:1–5 and 3 Nephi 7:17–18. How did the Lord feel about these missionaries and their service? - Think about the missionary efforts of Abinadi and Ammon (see Mosiah 11–18; Alma 17–20, 23–24). Why were both missionaries successful even though the immediate results of their efforts were different? - Record what you learn in your study journal. ### Remember This (Page 25) - Your purpose is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. - The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way by which we can find eternal happiness. - Your calling gives you authority; keeping your covenants gives you power. - The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet. - You help people live the gospel by inviting them to make and keep commitments. - You show your love for the Lord and gratitude for His Atonement by bringing souls unto Him. - You are successful when you are obedient, live righteously, and do your best in helping others live the gospel. ##', '<5-hop>\n\nMissionary Work (Page 26) Following are statements made by Presidents of the Church in this dispensation. ### President Joseph Smith (1830–1844) (Page 26) “After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 113). “Let the Saints remember that great things depend on their individual exertion, and that they are called to be co-workers with us and the Holy Spirit in accomplishing the great work of the last days” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 178–79). ### President Brigham Young (1847–1877) (Page 26) “There is neither man or woman in this Church who is not on a mission. That mission will last as long as they live, and it is to do good, to promote righteousness, to teach the principles of truth, and to prevail upon themselves and everybody around them to live those principles that they may obtain eternal life” (Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 322). ### President John Taylor (1880–1887) (Page 26) “Our duty is to preach the gospel to all men. . . . This is what God expects of us” (The Gospel Kingdom, sel. G. Homer Durham [1943], 234–35). ### President Wilford Woodruff (1889–1898) (Page 26) “We have come to this earth upon a mission; . . . that we may have power to go forth and warn the nations of the earth. . . . As elders of Israel, very few of us fully comprehend our position, our calling, our relationship to God, our responsibility, our work the Lord requires at our hands” (The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, sel. G. Homer Durham [1946], 124). ### President Lorenzo Snow (1898–1901) (Page 26) “There is no mortal man that is so much interested in the success of an elder when he is preaching the gospel as the Lord that sent him to preach to the people who are the Lord’s children” (The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow, comp. Clyde J. Williams [1984], 70). ### President Joseph F. Smith (1901–1918) (page 26) “We have a mission in the world: each man, each woman, each child who has grown to understanding or to the years of accountability, ought . . . to be qualified to preach the truth, to bear testimony of the truth” (Gospel Doctrine, 13th ed. [1968], 251–52).']","Missionaries can effectively incorporate the importance of family into their teaching by relating the universal interest in family to the message of the Restoration. As described in the context, missionaries can emphasize that families are central to God's plan and that the restored gospel strengthens families, providing peace, joy, and a sense of belonging. By highlighting that family ties are eternal and rooted in our relationship with God, missionaries can connect these feelings to the Restoration, explaining that true doctrines and ordinances have been restored to help families understand their place in God's family. This approach not only resonates with people's natural interest in family but also provides a unique perspective on how the gospel can help achieve strong, happy families, which is a priority for many. Additionally, by working with Church members who can introduce investigators and provide a support system, missionaries can further enhance the impact of their message, as members can bear testimony and offer friendship, making the teachings more relatable and impactful."
"How can personal study and reflection in a missionary's study journal enhance accountability and spiritual growth, according to the guidelines provided in the missionary manual?","['<1-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 166) ### Personal Study (Page 166) - In your study journal, write a one-sentence answer for each of the questions in “Consider This.” - Take a few moments and think about your final day in the mission field. When that day comes: - What do you want to say you have done as a missionary? - What do you want to have become? - What differences would you want others to notice in you? In your study journal, write an answer to each of these questions. Determine what you need to do now to realize these goals. Write the plans that come to mind. ### Companion Study (Page 166) - Using your area book, answer the questions below: - Are all the records current, accurate, and easy to read? - Would a missionary who is new to the area be able to review the area book and know where people are in their spiritual progress and what more needs to be done to help them? - Would a missionary who is new to the area benefit from your efforts to find new investigators? - Picture yourself presenting your area book to the Lord as you give an accounting of how you have cared for the people in your area. Would the Lord be pleased with your efforts? - Discuss one of your new investigators. In your Missionary Daily Planner, locate the page titled “Events That Lead to Baptism, Confirmation, and Activity in the Church.” Select one event, and make a list of everything you need to do in order for this event to happen. Discuss how you might plan these tasks so that the event can happen at the earliest possible time. - Discuss the following analogy with your companion. Evaluate how long your “line” is in the water each day. “None of us should be like the fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and fussing with his equipment. Fishing success is related to how long you have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the apartment. Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for ten hours. Other fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two hours. This last type may wonder why they do not have the same success as others. “The same principle applies to missionaries, whom the Master called ‘fishers of men.’ A missionary’s line should drop into the fishing water the moment he or she leaves the apartment” (Dallin H. Oaks, seminar for new mission presidents, June 20, 2000). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 166) - Read one of the following situations to the missionaries. In small groups, have the missionaries discuss goals and plans that will help the people in these examples progress toward baptism and confirmation. Have each group share their ideas. - Situation one: You met Larry and Beth when they were giving service at a food kitchen. You have taught them one lesson, and now they want to know more. They do not know any members of the Church. Beth is Christian, and Larry does not claim any particular religion. They are not married but do live together. Larry works from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. Beth works daytime hours. - Situation two: Steve has taken all the lessons and attends church at least twice a month. He believes that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that the Book of Mormon is true. His family members are devout Catholics and do not approve of his meetings with the missionaries. - Situation three: Jill is a college student. She has a friend who is @ member of the Church. Her member friend invited her to meet with you. You have taught her two lessons. Her member friend was present at both. She has not attended church yet and is so busy with her homework that it is difficult for her to read from the Book of Mormon. - Invite missionaries to share experiences where, through setting goals and making plans, they have been able to help people: - Develop greater faith in the Savior. - Repent and make changes that have brought them closer to God. - Receive the covenant of baptism and confirmation. - Come back to the Church and renew their baptismal covenant. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Explain that each group will receive an important assignment. Then give each group one of the following tasks: - Open a new proselyting area. - Prepare a zone conference training session on introducing the Book of Mormon 0 to investigators. - Integrate an investigator family into the ward. The family has three children: an 8-year-old girl, a 12-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old boy. Tell the missionaries they have eight minutes to develop a plan. One of the missionaries should write the plan down, including the daily activities. Have each group present its plan. After each presentation, ask: - What did the missionaries need to know in each situation? - What might the result be if you do not plan meaningful activities or do not plan at all? After all the presentations, ask: - How are planning and goal setting acts of love? acts of faith? ### Mission President (Page 167) - Ask missionaries to bring their area books to zone conference or to interviews. In addition to reviewing the area books yourself, consider having mission leaders or your wife review the area books. - Occasionally observe missionaries’ weekly or daily planning sessions. - Occasionally conduct interviews in missionary apartments. As you do so, have your wife or the assistants to the president review missionaries’ area books and daily planners. - Frequently review missionaries’ daily planners. - Occasionally attend a ward council meeting. > Beginning of Chapter 9', '<2-hop>\n\nDo not use these tools or the information you receive as ways to control or manipulate.

He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world. Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal. The Family of God. All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see Acts 17:26–29; Hebrews 12:9). We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious . . . ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (Alma 31:34–35). “Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message.']","Personal study and reflection in a missionary's study journal can enhance accountability and spiritual growth by encouraging missionaries to write one-sentence answers to reflective questions about their mission goals and personal development. This process helps them determine what actions are necessary to achieve their goals and allows them to plan accordingly. By documenting their thoughts and plans, missionaries can hold themselves accountable for their progress and ensure that their efforts align with their spiritual objectives. Additionally, the manual emphasizes the importance of using tools like the area book and Missionary Daily Planner to track progress and set goals, which further supports accountability and spiritual growth. As President Thomas S. Monson stated, 'When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.' This underscores the role of accountability in enhancing a missionary's dedication and effectiveness in their spiritual journey."
How can companionship inventory and teaching feedback enhance the effectiveness of missionaries in their assigned areas?,"['<1-hop>\n\nSet goals and make plans for lessons you will teach. Determine how you will help these people attend sacrament meeting and keep other commitments. 10. Set goals and make plans to find new investigators. Review the previous week’s efforts to find new investigators through referrals, service opportunities, and personal finding activities. Refer to the information in the “Potential Investigators” section of your area book. Discuss why some people became new investigators and others did not. Set goals for how many new investigators you will find this week. Identify people who are likely to become investigators. Also identify members and part-member families you want to visit, referrals to visit, and service opportunities you will seek. Plan which finding tools you will use, such as pass-along cards, videocassettes, DVDs, scriptures, or brochures. Also discuss where you will go to contact people, how many people you will contact each day, investigators you will ask for referrals, former investigators you will visit, ways the ward council can help, and so on. Make specific plans for the next day. Fill in all remaining time with finding activities that will help you achieve your goals. Set goals and plan to talk to as many people as the Lord puts in your path. Always strive to find people to teach. 11. Plan how to work with the ward council. The bishop is the presiding authority. Respect and honor his authority. Under his direction, review the Progress Record used in the previous missionary coordination meeting or ward council. Discuss assignments you have received from the bishop or ward mission leader, and report on whether you have completed them. Discuss how to involve others who can help, such as the ward mission leader, priesthood and auxiliary leaders, and other members. Carefully prepare a Progress Record for the upcoming ward council meeting, priesthood executive committee meeting, or missionary coordination meeting. Make sure it is neatly written and clean. Set goals and make plans to work in harmony with the ward leaders. When possible, make copies of the Progress Record for the ward leaders who will attend. 12. Schedule meetings that occur regularly. In your Missionary Daily Planner, schedule meetings that happen regularly, such as district meetings, zone conferences, interviews, and Church meetings. Discuss assignments you need to complete prior to any of these meetings, and add them to your Notes/To Do List. 13. Conduct companionship inventory. At the end of your weekly planning session, share with your companion appropriate goals, and ask for his or her help to accomplish them. Discuss the strength of your relationship with your companion. Discuss any challenges that may be keeping your companionship from working in unity or from being obedient. Resolve conflicts. Share with your companion what you think his or her strengths are. Ask for suggestions on how you can improve. If needed, set goals that will improve your relationship. Conclude with prayer. ##', '<2-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching.

He wants you to watch over your area with love and great care. Your purpose is to help others come unto Him through baptism and confirmation. Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it. Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you. As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders. Your missionary call letter states: “You will also be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs. As you do these things the Lord will bless you and you will become an effective advocate and messenger of the truth. We place in you our confidence and pray that the Lord will help you meet your responsibilities in fulfilling this sacred assignment.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study Read Jacob 5:11–13, 61–64, 74–75, and answer these questions: - How does the Lord feel about His children? - What kind of effort does the Lord require of His servants? ##']","Companionship inventory and teaching feedback are crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of missionaries in their assigned areas. During companionship inventory, missionaries share appropriate goals with their companions and seek help to accomplish them. They discuss the strength of their relationship, resolve conflicts, and set goals to improve their relationship, concluding with prayer. This process fosters unity and obedience, which are essential for effective missionary work. Additionally, teaching feedback, as practiced in companion study and district meetings, involves practicing missionary lessons, improving language skills, and receiving feedback from native speakers. This feedback helps missionaries refine their teaching methods and language proficiency, ultimately making them more effective in their efforts to help others come unto the Lord through baptism and confirmation."
How does scripture study enhance the ability to teach by the Spirit according to missionary guidelines?,"['<1-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nStudying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain the baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). ####', '<3-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (page 192) - What does it mean to give “that portion that shall be meted unto every man”? - Alma 29:8, D&C 84:85 - What has the Lord promised faithful missionaries? - D&C 68:2–4, D&C 100:5–8, Matthew 10:19–20 ## Teach with Your Companion in Unity (Page 192) The Lord has commanded, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” (D&C 42:6). Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work together in unity. As you plan and study each day, discuss how you will teach so that you can be united and teach with one voice. Your teaching will be more powerful if you and your companion alternate giving brief portions of the lesson. Avoid falling into a routine when presenting the message. Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths of which he or she has testified. Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something. As companions, be ready to yield to each other so that you do not hinder the guidance of the Spirit. When you speak, maintain eye contact with the investigator. When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the investigator’s responses. #### Scripture Study (Page 193) - How do companions support one another? - Alma 12:1, D&C 42:6, D&C 52:9–10 ## Invite Members to Help You Teach (Page 193) Whenever possible invite members, preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the investigators. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of missionary work. It also provides friendship for the investigator. President Thomas S. Monson taught: *During the teaching process investigators can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new investigators so that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps the second or third visit. Can you appreciate, for example, when missionaries are working with those from the United Church of Canada, the strength of testimony of Brother and Sister William Stoneman, who had come from the United Church of Canada. Brother Stoneman, a printer, would say, “When I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was the lead printer for the United Church. I lost my job. But I found a better job. Even more, I found the truth in its entirety. You too can make the adjustment. You too can make the same decision. In fact, let us pick you up on Sunday morning so that we can sit together in church. Then you can hear and feel for yourself. We’ll be right by your side.” Anthony and Edith Belfiglio became such a fellowshipping couple to those who had Roman Catholic roots. The result was the same. It can be done. And such converts stay converted. In addition, the couples chosen to fulfill this assignment put their own roots even deeper in the rich soil of the gospel. Both Brother Stoneman and Brother Belfiglio became ordained patriarchs. The combined efforts of members and missionaries in such specific cooperation yield an abundant gathering of precious souls (missionary training satellite broadcast, 25 Apr. 2003).* ####']","Scripture study enhances the ability to teach by the Spirit by providing a deep understanding of the gospel, which is essential for missionaries. According to the guidelines, missionaries are encouraged to study scriptures such as 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to learn about the gospel. This study helps them to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in their own words, focusing on strengthening faith in Jesus Christ and helping others make commitments. By consistently studying and applying the doctrines, missionaries build their testimony and ability to teach with spiritual power, ensuring they are prepared to teach effectively and meet the needs of those they instruct."
How can personal study and sharing a testimony of Jesus Christ enhance a missionary's effectiveness in teaching the gospel?,"['<1-hop>\n\n## Ideas for Study and Application (page 28) ### Personal Study (Page 28) - Prepare a two-minute talk on one of the questions at the beginning of this chapter. Be prepared to share your talk with your companion or with other missionaries in a district meeting. - Ask recent converts to tell their conversion stories. What helped them gain “faith unto repentance” (Alma 34:17)? Why did they decide to be baptized and confirmed? What was it like for them to become new members of the Church? How could missionaries have served them better? - Consider what it means to raise the voice of warning (see Jacob 3:12; D&C 1:4; 38:41; 63:57–58; 88:81; 112:5; Ezekiel 3:17–21; 33:1–12). Write in your own words what it means and how you can go about doing it. - Read Mormon 8 and Moroni 1 and 10. As you read, ask yourself, “What was Moroni’s hope for our day? What did he want us to do with the Book of Mormon? What would I say to Moroni if I had the chance?” Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Consider the events in your life that have strengthened your testimony of Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Then write an answer to this question: What has helped you know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith? ### Companion Study (Page 28) - Share with each other your answers to the questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. - Share with each other what your hopes and desires were for your mission when you received your mission call. To what extent does your experience thus far meet your expectations? How can you meet these expectations more fully? - Read and discuss “Ministry” in the Bible Dictionary. - Select one of the following great missionaries, and read the references listed. As you read, discuss how this missionary (1) understood and committed himself to his calling, (2) demonstrated his attitude and desire for the work, and (3) helped others accept the gospel. - Alma (Mosiah 18) - Aaron (Alma 22; 23:1–6) - Nephi and Lehi (Helaman 5) - Peter (Acts 2) - Paul (Acts 16) - In the hymnbook, select two hymns under the topic “Restoration of the Gospel” (see page 424). Read or sing the hymns. Discuss the meaning of the words. - Read together “Faith,” “Repentance,” “Baptism,” and “Holy Ghost” in the Bible Dictionary. Read and discuss all the scripture references in each entry. - Read together “Dispensations” in the Bible Dictionary. Also read and discuss Doctrine and Covenants 136:37. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 29) - Invite two or three recent converts to share their conversion experiences. How did they feel about the missionaries? about what the missionaries taught? about keeping commitments? What most strongly influenced their conversion? - Invite a priesthood leader to talk to the missionaries about the opportunities and difficulties of building the Church in your area. - Read Alma 18 and discuss these questions: What were Lamoni’s feelings at the beginning of the story? How did they change? What feelings must a person have in order to receive the blessings of the gospel? Read Alma 34:15–16, and compare it with Lamoni’s story. How does Christ’s Atonement enable us to obtain mercy? - Discuss what it means to be a successful missionary. Invite missionaries to give specific examples of success. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Assign one group to read Acts 2:36–38 (Peter), another group to read Acts 16:25–33 (Paul), and the final group to read Mosiah 18:8–11 (Alma). Ask each group to answer the question, “What did this missionary do to help others increase in faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation?” Discuss what the missionaries learn from these stories that could help them exercise faith when inviting people to repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. - Several days before the meeting, assign several missionaries to ponder selected questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. Ask each missionary to prepare a two- to three-minute talk on his or her assigned question. During the district meeting or zone conference, allow the missionaries to give their talks. Following the talks, discuss what they learned and how they could use it in their missionary work. - Divide the missionaries into four groups. Ask each group to list as many truths, covenants, and ordinances as they can that were restored and revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Have each group share their results. Invite missionaries to share how any of the truths revealed through the Restoration has influenced their lives. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 29) 1.

To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns.', '<3-hop>\n\nActivity: Personal Study (Page 194) Imagine that you have a first appointment to teach a lesson to a family in a member’s home.

According to the context, effective daily study should begin with prayer and be an act of faith, requiring personal agency. This personal study allows missionaries to grow in the gospel and stay on the path to eternal life, ultimately blessing both themselves and those they teach. Additionally, sharing a testimony of Jesus Christ, as encouraged during interviews with the mission president, reinforces the missionary's understanding and commitment to their purpose. This practice not only strengthens their own faith but also helps them convey the doctrines of the gospel more convincingly to others, thereby enhancing their teaching effectiveness."
How does the concept of judgment in the gospel of Jesus Christ relate to the role of revelation in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 19) The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work. The Savior defined His gospel to include some very vital and basic doctrines. He came into the world to do His Father’s will, and His Father sent Him into the world to be lifted up on the cross. By His Atonement and Resurrection, all men will be lifted up to stand before Christ to be judged of their works, whether they be good or evil. Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and are baptized in Christ’s name can be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. If they endure to the end, they will stand spotless before Christ at the last day and will enter into the rest of the Lord. Christ will hold them guiltless before the Father. He will be their Mediator and Advocate. Those who do not endure in faithfulness to the end will be “cast into the fire . . . because of the justice of the Father.” (See 3 Nephi 27:13–22; compare 2 Nephi 31:10–21; 3 Nephi 11:31–41; D&C 76:40–42, 50–53.) The purpose of the gospel is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive the Savior’s mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. *Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You canenlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.” – HYRUM SMITH (HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, 6:323)** Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence. Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 116) - Occasionally ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you. - In interviews, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers.

It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching. ##']","The concept of judgment in the gospel of Jesus Christ is centered on the idea that individuals will be judged by Christ based on their works, whether good or evil, and those who endure in faithfulness will stand spotless before Him. This is achieved through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Revelation plays a crucial role in missionary work as it guides missionaries in teaching these principles effectively. Missionaries are encouraged to share spiritual experiences and receive revelation on how to help investigators feel and recognize the Spirit. The Book of Mormon, as a powerful evidence of Christ's divinity and the Restoration, is used to build faith and help others draw closer to God, with the Holy Ghost providing a witness of its truth. Thus, revelation supports the missionary's role in guiding others towards the gospel's path to judgment and salvation."

There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nThe Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nPersonal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes), and prepare for the day. - 7:30 a.m. Breakfast. - 8:00 a.m. Personal study: the Book of Mormon, other scriptures, doctrines of the missionary lessons, other chapters from Preach My Gospel, the Missionary Handbook, and the Missionary Health Guide. - 9:00 a.m. Companion study: share what you have learned during personal study, prepare to teach, practice teaching, study chapters from Preach My Gospel, confirm plans for the day. - 10:00 a.m. Begin proselyting. Missionaries learning a language study that language for an additional 30 to 60 minutes, including planning language learning activities to use during the day. Missionaries may take an hour for lunch and additional study, and an hour for dinner at times during the day that fit best with their proselyting. Normally dinner should be finished no later than 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. Return to living quarters (unless teaching a lesson; then return by 9:30) and plan the next day’s activities (30 minutes). Write in journal, prepare for bed, pray. - 10:30 p.m. Retire to bed. \\*In consultation with the Presidency of the Seventy or the Area Presidency, your mission president may modify this schedule to meet local circumstances. What you learn in personal study will help you in companion study, district meeting, and zone conferences, where you can “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). What you gain from your study sessions and district meetings will help you teach with spiritual power. ### Personal Study (page 10) The purpose of personal study is to strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. In your personal study, focus on the standard works and the approved missionary library: - Jesus the Christ - Our Heritage - Our Search for Happiness - True to the Faith You can make personal study effective as you: - Read from the Book of Mormon and other scriptures. - Study the doctrines of the missionary lessons. - Study other chapters from Preach My Gospel. ### Companion Study (Page 11) The purpose of companion study is to (1) build unity in your companionship in order to teach by the Spirit and (2) focus on the progress of those you teach. You can make companion study effective as you: - Share insights with each other from personal study. - Prepare for specific teaching appointments, member visits, finding opportunities, and other activities. Study material that helps you teach, find, and work more effectively. Discuss the people with whom you are working. Make plans to apply what you are learning. - Throughout the day, continue to discuss the principles, goals, skills, and plans from companion study. ### District Meetings (Page 11) The purpose of district meeting is to “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). - District meetings are held each week for 60 to 90 minutes. - The district leader plans and conducts the district meeting and may invite other missionaries to help teach. - District meetings may include: – Sharing insights from personal and companion study. – Practicing the lessons in various settings. – Explaining, demonstrating, and practicing principles and skills described in Preach My Gospel. – Discussing the progress and needs of investigators. – Discussing and addressing challenges in the district. – Sharing experiences and testimonies of missionary work. - District leaders may use district meeting to receive reports regarding the efforts of missionaries in the district. They should not set goals or quotas for other missionaries.']","Spiritual preparation and missionary lessons are integral to a missionary's daily work. Spiritual preparation is emphasized through personal and companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences, which are designed to strengthen a missionary's testimony and knowledge of the gospel. Personal study focuses on the standard works and approved missionary library, while companion study builds unity and focuses on the progress of those being taught. Missionary lessons, on the other hand, provide flexibility in teaching, allowing missionaries to adapt lessons to the needs of investigators and the guidance of the Spirit. This approach helps missionaries effectively prepare individuals for baptism and confirmation, ensuring that they come unto Christ through faith, repentance, and enduring to the end."
How can prayer and teaching ideas be effectively combined to help individuals understand the truth of the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of the gospel?,"['<1-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##', '<2-hop>\n\nIdeas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","Prayer and teaching ideas can be effectively combined to help individuals understand the truth of the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of the gospel by encouraging them to pray sincerely to know the truth through the Holy Ghost, as outlined in the lesson on page 53. This involves addressing Heavenly Father, expressing gratitude, and asking to confirm the truth of the Book of Mormon. Teaching ideas from page 55 suggest using a short lesson plan to emphasize the restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith and the evidence provided by the Book of Mormon. By integrating these teaching ideas with the practice of prayer, individuals are invited to read, ponder, and pray about the Book of Mormon, which can lead to personal spiritual insights and a confirmation of its truth through the Holy Ghost."
How can the challenges in raising children be addressed through the teachings of the Restoration when beginning to teach investigators?,"['<1-hop>\n\nAddressing the Importance of the Family (Page 173) The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity. Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following: *There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity. Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.* You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration: *The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrines and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about . . .* The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nHow to Begin Teaching (Page 190) The first few moments with investigators are very important. Investigators must learn to trust you. Begin your first visit in a warm, respectful, genuine manner. Ask a few simple questions to help you understand their religious background and their expectations regarding your visits. For example, ask, “What role has religion played in your life?” Do not, however, ask personal questions that would make them uncomfortable. Before you begin, ask all who are present to join with you in the lesson. Encourage them to turn off the television and remove other distractions so that the Spirit of the Lord will not be hindered. Explain that you would like to begin and end each lesson in prayer. Suggest that you will offer the opening prayer. Pray simply but fervently that the Lord will bless the people you are teaching in every aspect of their lives, and especially that they can feel the truth of what you will teach. Demonstrate sincere interest and love for the investigators and faith in the converting power of the gospel (see Moroni 7:43–48). As guided by the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following to your investigators: - Because God is our Heavenly Father, we are all brothers and sisters. We would like to refer to you as brothers and sisters. - Each person we teach has personal challenges and concerns. No matter what your needs or concerns might be, the Savior and His teachings—the gospel—will help you. - Our message will enable you to improve the quality of your lives. It will help you deal with the problems and challenges that we all face in life. - Our message, which is centered in Jesus Christ, is of great value and importance. - We all make mistakes in life, and these mistakes create feelings of guilt and shame. These feelings cannot be relieved without repentance and forgiveness. They can be fully healed through the Atonement of Christ. - Our message cannot be learned all at once. Understanding will come over time through prayer, study, experience, and keeping God’s commandments. - We have weaknesses, as everyone does. We may not speak the language very well or be able to answer every question you have. But we have been called by a prophet of God to share what we know. We know that our message is true. - We will be guides so that you can learn the truth of our message for yourselves. It is your choice to accept and act on the message. Therefore, you should feel free to ask questions. - As you sincerely seek to understand our message, you may face challenges, but God will help you. - As you accept our message, you will learn how to make covenants, or promises, with God. You will learn how to make changes to bring your lives in closer harmony with His teachings. You will want to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be baptized by proper authority (see John 3:5). Before teaching the doctrines in a lesson, consider giving a simple overview of what you are going to teach. Help people see that it will have personal relevance for them. Many of the investigators you teach have been prepared by the Lord (see Alma 16:16–17). As you share spiritual experiences together in the first meeting, they will recognize you as servants of the Lord. ####']","The challenges in raising children can be addressed through the teachings of the Restoration by emphasizing the importance of family and the eternal nature of family relationships. When beginning to teach investigators, it is important to establish trust and demonstrate sincere interest in their personal challenges, including those related to family. By connecting the message of the Restoration to the natural interest people have in families, you can explain that the principles of the restored gospel provide hope for a strong, happy family. This includes understanding our place in God's family and the eternal nature of family ties. Additionally, by teaching that the gospel can help improve the quality of life and address personal challenges, investigators can see the relevance of the gospel in overcoming difficulties in raising children. Encouraging investigators to seek understanding through prayer, study, and experience can further help them apply these teachings to their family life."
"How can missionaries effectively apply scripture study to their personal growth and teaching, according to the guidelines provided in the missionary manual?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual.

They are encouraged to 'liken' what they learn to themselves by substituting their name in a verse of scripture and setting goals to live what they are learning. This involves asking themselves how they should change as a result of their learning and setting appropriate goals. Additionally, missionaries are advised to study in a conducive environment, such as at a desk or table, and to pray for understanding. They should study by topic, visualize what they are studying, and write in their study journal any questions they have, using scriptures and other resources to find answers. Sharing what they learn with other missionaries and marking scriptures with notes and references are also recommended practices. Furthermore, missionaries are encouraged to use study aids like the Topical Guide and Bible Dictionary, and to organize their study journal to easily recall what they have learned. These practices help in the personal application of learning and enhance their ability to teach effectively."
"How can missionaries effectively use record keeping and accountability to improve their performance and spiritual growth, as suggested in the missionary guidelines and teachings of President Thomas S. Monson?","['<1-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 166) ### Personal Study (Page 166) - In your study journal, write a one-sentence answer for each of the questions in “Consider This.” - Take a few moments and think about your final day in the mission field. When that day comes: - What do you want to say you have done as a missionary? - What do you want to have become? - What differences would you want others to notice in you? In your study journal, write an answer to each of these questions. Determine what you need to do now to realize these goals. Write the plans that come to mind. ### Companion Study (Page 166) - Using your area book, answer the questions below: - Are all the records current, accurate, and easy to read? - Would a missionary who is new to the area be able to review the area book and know where people are in their spiritual progress and what more needs to be done to help them? - Would a missionary who is new to the area benefit from your efforts to find new investigators? - Picture yourself presenting your area book to the Lord as you give an accounting of how you have cared for the people in your area. Would the Lord be pleased with your efforts? - Discuss one of your new investigators. In your Missionary Daily Planner, locate the page titled “Events That Lead to Baptism, Confirmation, and Activity in the Church.” Select one event, and make a list of everything you need to do in order for this event to happen. Discuss how you might plan these tasks so that the event can happen at the earliest possible time. - Discuss the following analogy with your companion. Evaluate how long your “line” is in the water each day. “None of us should be like the fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and fussing with his equipment. Fishing success is related to how long you have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the apartment. Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for ten hours. Other fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two hours. This last type may wonder why they do not have the same success as others. “The same principle applies to missionaries, whom the Master called ‘fishers of men.’ A missionary’s line should drop into the fishing water the moment he or she leaves the apartment” (Dallin H. Oaks, seminar for new mission presidents, June 20, 2000). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 166) - Read one of the following situations to the missionaries. In small groups, have the missionaries discuss goals and plans that will help the people in these examples progress toward baptism and confirmation. Have each group share their ideas. - Situation one: You met Larry and Beth when they were giving service at a food kitchen. You have taught them one lesson, and now they want to know more. They do not know any members of the Church. Beth is Christian, and Larry does not claim any particular religion. They are not married but do live together. Larry works from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. Beth works daytime hours. - Situation two: Steve has taken all the lessons and attends church at least twice a month. He believes that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that the Book of Mormon is true. His family members are devout Catholics and do not approve of his meetings with the missionaries. - Situation three: Jill is a college student. She has a friend who is @ member of the Church. Her member friend invited her to meet with you. You have taught her two lessons. Her member friend was present at both. She has not attended church yet and is so busy with her homework that it is difficult for her to read from the Book of Mormon. - Invite missionaries to share experiences where, through setting goals and making plans, they have been able to help people: - Develop greater faith in the Savior. - Repent and make changes that have brought them closer to God. - Receive the covenant of baptism and confirmation. - Come back to the Church and renew their baptismal covenant. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Explain that each group will receive an important assignment. Then give each group one of the following tasks: - Open a new proselyting area. - Prepare a zone conference training session on introducing the Book of Mormon 0 to investigators. - Integrate an investigator family into the ward. The family has three children: an 8-year-old girl, a 12-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old boy. Tell the missionaries they have eight minutes to develop a plan. One of the missionaries should write the plan down, including the daily activities. Have each group present its plan. After each presentation, ask: - What did the missionaries need to know in each situation? - What might the result be if you do not plan meaningful activities or do not plan at all? After all the presentations, ask: - How are planning and goal setting acts of love? acts of faith? ### Mission President (Page 167) - Ask missionaries to bring their area books to zone conference or to interviews. In addition to reviewing the area books yourself, consider having mission leaders or your wife review the area books. - Occasionally observe missionaries’ weekly or daily planning sessions. - Occasionally conduct interviews in missionary apartments. As you do so, have your wife or the assistants to the president review missionaries’ area books and daily planners. - Frequently review missionaries’ daily planners. - Occasionally attend a ward council meeting. > Beginning of Chapter 9', '<2-hop>\n\nDo not use these tools or the information you receive as ways to control or manipulate.

(Page 169) #### Consider This (Page 169) - What does it mean to “find them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8)? - How do I increase my faith to find people to teach? - Why should I involve members in my finding efforts? - What is the role of media and Church headquarters referrals? - What is the relationship between finding and teaching? - What is the role of service in finding people to teach? - What are some ideas for finding people to teach that I have not yet tried? ## Developing the Faith to Find (Page 169) The doctrines and principles in this chapter will strengthen your faith that the Lord is preparing people to receive you and the restored gospel. He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world. Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal. The Family of God. All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see Acts 17:26–29; Hebrews 12:9). We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious . . . ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (Alma 31:34–35). “Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message.']","Missionaries can effectively use record keeping and accountability to improve their performance and spiritual growth by maintaining accurate and current records in their area books, as suggested in the missionary guidelines. This practice ensures that new missionaries can easily understand the spiritual progress of individuals in their area and what more needs to be done to help them. Additionally, missionaries are encouraged to use their study journals to reflect on their goals and the differences they want to make as missionaries. President Thomas S. Monson emphasized that 'when performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.' This principle highlights the importance of accountability in enhancing missionary efforts. By setting goals according to key indicators, conducting regular planning sessions, and accounting for their efforts to the Lord and mission leaders, missionaries can stretch their faith, work effectively, and help others progress in the gospel."
"How do family baptism considerations and missionary responsibilities intersect when a father is not ready for baptism, and what role does the ward play in supporting new converts?","['<1-hop>\n\nBaptism and Confirmation: Questions and Answers (Page 220) 1. Who conducts the interview for baptism? Normally the district leader interviews baptismal candidates taught by missionaries in his district, including candidates taught by his zone leaders. The zone leader interviews candidates taught by the district leader. The mission president or someone he assigns must interview people involved in serious sins. District or zone leaders do not interview baptismal candidates outside their own district or zone unless the mission president assigns them to do so. 2. What is the definition of a convert baptism? Convert baptisms are baptisms of: - Persons ages nine and older who have never before been baptized and confirmed as members of the Church. - Children age eight whose parents are both nonmembers or whose parents are being baptized and confirmed at the same time as the child. 3. Do I need permission to baptize a minor child? Before you can teach and baptize an investigator who is under legal age, you must obtain permission of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s), preferably in writing. In addition, you should have good reason to believe that the child understands the baptismal covenant and will make every effort to keep it through obedience to the gospel, including faithfully attending Church meetings. 4. Do I need permission of the spouse in order to baptize a husband or wife? Yes. Do not baptize a married person without the consent of his or her spouse. 5. If the father in a family is not ready for baptism, should I baptize the family or wait until the father is ready? If the father of a family is not ready for baptism and confirmation but other family members are, you may tell the father you prefer not to baptize the family without him because the Church respects the head of the home and because family members will progress in the gospel best as a family unit. If the father continues to decline, you may baptize and confirm other family members with his consent. 6. Is it a good idea to ordain a father to the Aaronic Priesthood immediately after baptism so that he can baptize other family members? No. The father must be confirmed in a sacrament meeting and, after an interview with the bishop, be sustained to receive the Aaronic Priesthood. Baptisms of family members should not be delayed so that the father can perform the baptisms himself. 7. May I teach and baptize a person who has been excommunicated? Baptisms of excommunicated persons are not convert baptisms, and missionaries do not interview such persons for baptism. You may work with such persons only under the close supervision of the mission president and bishop. 8. What if a person has a scheduled baptismal date but is not keeping all of the commitments? If you feel that someone you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule a baptismal interview until the investigator is keeping the commitments and meets the standards. 9. What do I do when people want to be baptized but are living together without being married? Baptismal candidates who have been living with a person of the opposite gender out of wedlock must either marry or stop living together before they can be baptized. 10. Question 4 in the baptismal interview asks if a person has been involved in a serious sin, such as an abortion, a homosexual relationship, or a serious crime. What should I do if someone confesses such a sin? - **Instructions for teaching missionaries.** Sometimes investigators may volunteer information about such sins as you teach about the commandments and invite them to make commitments. However, if they do not say anything but you think they may have a problem, prepare them for the baptismal interview by asking them if they have been involved in any of these sins. If you become aware of a serious sin, do not ask about the details of the sin. Do not schedule a baptismal date or make any promises about whether they will be cleared for baptism and confirmation. Express your love and review the principle of repentance. Kindly explain that these sins are serious and that a person with more maturity and experience (your mission president or someone he assigns) will talk with them and help them with these matters. Then send a baptismal interview request directly to the mission president. - **Instructions for the person conducting the interview for baptism.** If the missionaries have properly taught the candidate before the baptismal interview, these issues, if they exist, should have been directed to the mission president. If they do arise, express your love and review the commandments and the principle of repentance. Kindly explain that these sins are serious and that a person with more maturity and experience (your mission president or someone he assigns) will talk with them and help them with these matters. Then forward a baptismal interview request directly to the mission president. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nActivity: Personal Study (Page 222) Think about how you might feel if you were being interviewed. Consider the following questions: - What aspects of the interview might be strange to you? What could the interviewer do or say to put you at ease? - How would you want the interviewer to interact with you? - How would you want the interviewer to respond if you expressed doubts or misunderstandings or if you confessed serious sins? Write your answers to these questions in your study journal. ## Complete the Baptism Record (Page 222) The missionary who conducts the interview should fill out a current Baptism Record according to the instructions on the form. He should explain that a membership record is created from the Baptism Record and will contain important information about the new members and the ordinances they have received. Whenever members move, the membership record is forwarded to the new unit so that their new bishop can provide fellowship and assistance. The missionary should ask the candidate to verify the information on the form during the interview. The missionary who conducts the interview should bring the Baptism Record to the baptismal service and give it to the person who is presiding. The bishop ensures that a Confirmation Record/Baptism and Confirmation Certificate form is filled out for each candidate according to instructions on the form. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (page 222) Study Mosiah 6:1–3 and Moroni 6:1–4. How do these passages relate to your responsibility for keeping accurate records of baptisms and confirmations? ## The Baptismal Service (Page 222) The Spirit is manifest strongly as the sacred ordinances of baptism and confirmation are performed. The baptismal service and subsequent confirmation should be spiritual highlights for new converts. You and the ward mission leader should do everything you can to ensure that the baptismal service is organized, inspiring, and memorable. These services should strengthen the new converts in their commitment to remain active. Invite the bishopric, quorum and auxiliary leaders, and home teachers and visiting teachers (if assigned) to attend the baptismal service. The friends and relatives of the converts and all of your current investigators should be invited to attend the baptismal service and the sacrament meeting where the confirmation takes place. These experiences will help them feel the Spirit and prepare them to accept an invitation to learn more about the gospel. Work with the baptismal candidate and ward mission leader to invite the candidate’s friends and relatives to attend. Then follow through after the service to discuss their experience and invite them to learn why their friend chose to be baptized. The missionaries who taught the baptismal candidate coordinate with the ward mission leader to organize the service. Explain to the baptismal candidate what is planned and why. Discuss proper dress, including how the candidate will be given white clothing to wear for the baptism. Agree on the place and time for the baptism. A member of the bishopric or the ward mission leader normally conducts the service. Following are essential items to plan and organize. A baptismal service may include: 1. Prelude music. 2. A brief welcome by the priesthood leader conducting the service (a member of the bishopric should preside). 3. An opening hymn and prayer. 4. One or two short talks on gospel subjects, such as baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. 5. A musical selection. 6. Performance of the baptism. 7. A time of reverence while the people who participate in the baptism change into dry clothes. This could include listening to interlude music, singing well-known hymns and Primary songs, showing a Church audiovisual product, or bearing testimony. 8. An opportunity for new converts to bear their testimonies, if desired. 9. A closing hymn and prayer. 10. Postlude music. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nStrengthening New and Less-Active Members (Page 227) When converts are baptized and confirmed, they make sacred promises to obey and serve God and others for the rest of their lives. They become candidates for salvation in the celestial kingdom. To receive the promised blessings, they must endure to the end with faith in Jesus Christ. Church members are essential in helping new converts remain active and faithful. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: “There is absolutely no point in doing missionary work unless we hold on to the fruits of that effort. The two must be inseparable. . . . Every convert is a great and serious responsibility” (“Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,” Ensign, May 1999, 108). Under the direction of the bishop, the ward council has first responsibility for strengthening new members and less-active members. They make sure that new converts and less-active members have friends, are nourished by the word of God, and receive callings and responsibilities. They may request that full-time missionaries help in home teaching (or sister missionaries with visiting teaching) and in visiting new members, less- active members, and prospective elders. Preferably you will be paired with a member for such visits. You are also responsible for these people. President Hinckley said: “You missionaries . . . are part of this responsibility of binding your converts to the Church. You may not be able to continue to visit them. But you can write to them occasionally and give them encouragement. . . . When you go home do not forget them. At all times live worthy of their trust. Write to them occasionally, assuring them of your love” (Ensign, May 1999, 109). When attending church meetings, you and your companion should sit with your investigators or members you have been fellowshipping to support and strengthen them. You should not sit in a group with other missionaries. A vital part of your mission is to establish the Church and strengthen the unit in which you serve. You do this in part by helping new converts remain active and by helping less-active members return to activity. One of your duties is to join with ward missionaries to teach again the first four lessons and to teach lesson 5. Ward missionaries, home teachers, and visiting teachers can also help teach these principles. President Gordon B. Hinckley related the following concerning the challenges many new converts face: *I received the other day a very interesting letter. It was written by a woman who joined the Church a year ago. She writes: “My journey into the Church was unique and quite challenging. This past year has been the hardest year that I have ever lived in my life. It has also been the most rewarding. As a new member, I continue to be challenged every day.” She goes on to say that when she joined the Church she did not feel support from the leadership in her ward. Her bishop seemed indifferent to her as a new member. Rebuffed, as she felt, she turned back to her mission president, who opened opportunities for her. She states that “Church members don’t know what it is like to be a new member. . . . Therefore, it’s almost impossible for them to know how to support us.” I challenge you, my brothers and sisters, that if you do not know what it is like, you try to imagine what it is like. It can be terribly lonely. It can be disappointing. It can be frightening. We of this Church are far more different from the world than we are prone to think we are. This woman goes on: “When we as investigators become members of the Church, we are surprised to discover that we have entered into a completely foreign world, a world that has its own traditions, culture, and language. We discover that there is no one person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration and anger that we leave.']","When a father in a family is not ready for baptism, missionaries are advised to express a preference not to baptize the family without him, respecting the head of the home and emphasizing the importance of progressing in the gospel as a family unit. However, if the father continues to decline, other family members may be baptized with his consent. Missionaries are responsible for ensuring that the baptismal service is organized and memorable, working with the ward mission leader to invite friends and relatives to the service. The ward council, under the direction of the bishop, plays a crucial role in supporting new converts by ensuring they have friends, are nourished by the word of God, and receive callings and responsibilities. This support helps new converts remain active and faithful, fulfilling the missionaries' responsibility to bind converts to the Church."
How can missionaries effectively use their time and learning activities to achieve their goals in the mission field?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 166) ### Personal Study (Page 166) - In your study journal, write a one-sentence answer for each of the questions in “Consider This.” - Take a few moments and think about your final day in the mission field. When that day comes: - What do you want to say you have done as a missionary? - What do you want to have become? - What differences would you want others to notice in you? In your study journal, write an answer to each of these questions. Determine what you need to do now to realize these goals. Write the plans that come to mind. ### Companion Study (Page 166) - Using your area book, answer the questions below: - Are all the records current, accurate, and easy to read? - Would a missionary who is new to the area be able to review the area book and know where people are in their spiritual progress and what more needs to be done to help them? - Would a missionary who is new to the area benefit from your efforts to find new investigators? - Picture yourself presenting your area book to the Lord as you give an accounting of how you have cared for the people in your area. Would the Lord be pleased with your efforts? - Discuss one of your new investigators. In your Missionary Daily Planner, locate the page titled “Events That Lead to Baptism, Confirmation, and Activity in the Church.” Select one event, and make a list of everything you need to do in order for this event to happen. Discuss how you might plan these tasks so that the event can happen at the earliest possible time. - Discuss the following analogy with your companion. Evaluate how long your “line” is in the water each day. “None of us should be like the fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and fussing with his equipment. Fishing success is related to how long you have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the apartment. Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for ten hours. Other fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two hours. This last type may wonder why they do not have the same success as others. “The same principle applies to missionaries, whom the Master called ‘fishers of men.’ A missionary’s line should drop into the fishing water the moment he or she leaves the apartment” (Dallin H. Oaks, seminar for new mission presidents, June 20, 2000). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 166) - Read one of the following situations to the missionaries. In small groups, have the missionaries discuss goals and plans that will help the people in these examples progress toward baptism and confirmation. Have each group share their ideas. - Situation one: You met Larry and Beth when they were giving service at a food kitchen. You have taught them one lesson, and now they want to know more. They do not know any members of the Church. Beth is Christian, and Larry does not claim any particular religion. They are not married but do live together. Larry works from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. Beth works daytime hours. - Situation two: Steve has taken all the lessons and attends church at least twice a month. He believes that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that the Book of Mormon is true. His family members are devout Catholics and do not approve of his meetings with the missionaries. - Situation three: Jill is a college student. She has a friend who is @ member of the Church. Her member friend invited her to meet with you. You have taught her two lessons. Her member friend was present at both. She has not attended church yet and is so busy with her homework that it is difficult for her to read from the Book of Mormon. - Invite missionaries to share experiences where, through setting goals and making plans, they have been able to help people: - Develop greater faith in the Savior. - Repent and make changes that have brought them closer to God. - Receive the covenant of baptism and confirmation. - Come back to the Church and renew their baptismal covenant. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Explain that each group will receive an important assignment. Then give each group one of the following tasks: - Open a new proselyting area. - Prepare a zone conference training session on introducing the Book of Mormon 0 to investigators. - Integrate an investigator family into the ward. The family has three children: an 8-year-old girl, a 12-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old boy. Tell the missionaries they have eight minutes to develop a plan. One of the missionaries should write the plan down, including the daily activities. Have each group present its plan. After each presentation, ask: - What did the missionaries need to know in each situation? - What might the result be if you do not plan meaningful activities or do not plan at all? After all the presentations, ask: - How are planning and goal setting acts of love? acts of faith? ### Mission President (Page 167) - Ask missionaries to bring their area books to zone conference or to interviews. In addition to reviewing the area books yourself, consider having mission leaders or your wife review the area books. - Occasionally observe missionaries’ weekly or daily planning sessions. - Occasionally conduct interviews in missionary apartments. As you do so, have your wife or the assistants to the president review missionaries’ area books and daily planners. - Frequently review missionaries’ daily planners. - Occasionally attend a ward council meeting. > Beginning of Chapter 9', '<2-hop>\n\n### Zone Conferences (Page 11) Zone conferences are held under the direction of the mission president. ### Study Journal (Page 12) Preach My Gospel frequently asks that you use a study journal to help you understand, clarify, and remember what you are learning. Elder Richard G. Scott taught, “Knowledge carefully recorded is knowledge available in time of need. Spiritually sensitive information should be kept in a sacred place that communicates to the Lord how you treasure it. This practice enhances the likelihood of your receiving further light” (“Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge,” Ensign, Nov. 1993, 86). Review your study journal to recall spiritual experiences, see new insights, and recognize your growth. Your study journal may be a bound journal, a notebook, or a binder. Record and organize your thoughts and impressions in a way that fits how you learn. Develop your own system to easily access key information in the future. Use it often to review, access, and apply what you have learned. Use your study journal to take notes and record impressions during your personal and companion study, district meetings, zone conferences, and interviews with the mission president. ### Ideas for Study and Application (Page 13) Each chapter concludes with additional ideas for personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. This rich resource of learning activities provides examples of effective ways to learn the material. Be creative and seek inspiration to create additional activities each time you study or teach one of these sections. Complete these activities several times during your mission. ## Missionaries Serving in Branches and Districts (Page 13) Many missionaries serve in branches and districts. Although this manual refers to wards and stakes, the same principles and approaches apply to branches and districts. The mission president will instruct you on any adjustments to make when working with branch and district leaders. ##']","Missionaries can effectively use their time by ensuring their 'line' is in the water as much as possible, meaning they should focus on actual missionary work rather than getting sidetracked by other activities. This concept is illustrated by the analogy of a fisherman who is successful because he spends more time with his line in the water. Additionally, missionaries should utilize learning activities such as personal and companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences to enhance their understanding and application of gospel principles. By recording insights in a study journal, missionaries can access and apply what they have learned, which helps in setting and achieving meaningful goals. These practices, combined with structured planning and goal setting, enable missionaries to develop greater faith, help others progress spiritually, and achieve their mission objectives."
"How can effective questioning enhance scripture study and understanding of gospel principles, and what role does it play in teaching for understanding according to the teachings of the Latter-day Saints?","['<1-hop>\n\n#### Cultural Views of Scriptures (Page 195) Most religions have sacred texts or books of scripture, but their use and perception of them may be different from how members of the Church view scriptures. For example, you may need to explain that your marking of scriptures is evidence of your desire to understand and apply the teachings of the scriptures and is not a sign of disrespect. Help those you teach see that the standard works are important because they contain the word of the Lord as written by prophets of God and that we accept them as truth. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 196) Review one of the following passages. Determine how you would: - Introduce the passage. - Provide background and context. - Read the passage and explain its meaning. - Explain difficult words. - Help investigators apply it in their lives. Title Page of the Book of Mormon; 3 Nephi 11; Moroni 10:3–8; John 17:3; Romans 8:16–17; 1 Corinthians 15:29; James 1:5; 1 Peter 3:19–20; Amos 3:7 #### Scripture Study (Page 196) - Why is it important to teach from the scriptures? - 1 Nephi 19:23, 2 Nephi 4:15–16, D&C 20:7–12, 2 Timothy 3:15–17 ## Teach for Understanding (Page 196) People are better able to believe the message of the Restoration of the gospel when they understand the message. President James E. Faust said: “Study, ponder, and teach from the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon and the New Testament. Know the truth so well that you can state it clearly. B. H. Roberts wrote, ‘To be known, the truth must be stated and the clearer and more complete the statement is, the better the opportunity will the Holy Spirit have for testifying to the souls of men that the work is true.’ [New Witnesses for God, 3 vols. (1909), 2:vii]. You cannot convert people beyond your own conversion” (“What I Want My Son to Know before He Leaves on His Mission,” Ensign, May 1996, 41). You are commanded to reason with and expound the scriptures when you teach (see D&C 68:1). Expound means to enlarge on and to explain clearly. Expounding the gospel means that you explain the meaning of doctrines and scriptural passages simply and clearly, relying on the Spirit to guide what you say. You use dignified but conversational language to help people understand the doctrinal principle. You ask questions to help them think about the principles and to see if they understand and accept what you have taught. At the end of each of the first three lessons in chapter 3 is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Part of teaching for understanding is to make sure you explain words, phrases, and ideas so that other people understand you better. You can improve your ability to explain the gospel by: - Understanding the words you use. - Defining words others may not understand. Many words that mean special things to members of the Church are defined simply in the Bible Dictionary and True to the Faith. - Asking people questions like, “Do you know what we mean when we say . . . ?” or “Can you restate what we just talked about in your own words?” As you study the doctrine in chapter 3, identify words you think may be difficult for an investigator to understand. As you teach the doctrine in chapter 3, make notes of words, phrases, and ideas that investigators have a hard time understanding. Define those words using the resources mentioned above. Test your definitions with investigators and recent converts. #### Scripture Study (Page 197) - Why should we expound or explain doctrines carefully? - Mosiah 8:3, Mosiah 27:35, D&C 68:1-5 D&C 71:1 - How do we learn? Why is it important to unfold or gradually disclose information? - 2 Nephi 28:30, Jacob 4:13, D&C 98:11-12, Mosiah 2:9 - Why is plainness important? - 2 Nephi 25:4, 7, 28; Alma 13:23, 2 Nephi 32:7, Nehemiah 8:8 How does the Lord communicate with His children? - 2 Nephi 31:3, D&C 1:24 ##', '<2-hop>\n\nAsk Questions (Page 197) Jesus Christ often asked questions to help people ponder and apply principles. His questions prompted thought, soul searching, and commitment. Good questions will help you understand interests, concerns, or questions that others have. They can enhance your teaching, invite the Spirit, and help your investigators learn. Poor questions can intimidate, irritate, and offend investigators. They can also cause you to lose control of the teaching situation. Try to ask questions that: - Are simple and easy to understand. - Help people think about what you are teaching. - Help people apply what they learn. - Help you determine how well the investigator understands what you are teaching. As those you teach respond to these types of questions, they will feel that they can talk openly. Good questions can lead investigators to ask you questions when they don’t understand, when they have a concern, or when they want to know what to do. Good questions can help those you teach share their feelings and by so doing discover a growing testimony. Examples of effective questions include: - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - Do you believe that Heavenly Father loves you? Why? - How do we sometimes make the same error as the people in this story? To help those you teach prepare to answer questions, you may want to say, “As I explain the importance of keeping the Sabbath day holy, ask yourself, ‘What does this commandment mean to me?’” Avoid asking questions that: - Include more than one idea. - Pertain to doctrines you have not yet taught. - Do not have a clear purpose. - Interrogate and pry unnecessarily. Asking too many questions, especially in your first visit, gives the impression that you are conducting an “interrogation.” Do not ask investigators to give specific answers about unimportant or obvious details. This will turn a good teaching environment into a game of guessing. When you need a specific answer, it is best to ask a factual question or present the information in some other way. Avoid asking questions that might embarrass someone if they do not know the answers. Questions are most useful when asked after you have taught and testified about a key principle. Following are examples of less- effective questions: - Who was the first prophet? (Asked before teaching about dispensations.) - How will keeping our bodies pure help us have the Spirit and show that we are willing to follow a prophet of God? (More than one idea.) - Is it important to know about God’s commandments? (Yes-no answer and too obvious.) - How do you feel about the Book of Mormon? (Before they have read it.) - What is something we can do every day that will help us feel close to God? (Vague question looking for a specific answer: pray.) - Who was the next prophet after Noah? (Asking them to guess.) Learn to ask questions as prompted by the Spirit. The right type of question at the right time can greatly help those you teach to learn the gospel and feel the Spirit. Likewise, the wrong type of question or a question at the wrong time can interfere with their learning. Asking appropriate questions at the right time requires that you are in tune with the Spirit, that you listen to those you are teaching, and that you focus throughout the teaching experience. Effective teaching can be hard work and requires concentration and effort on the part of you and your companion. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 199) What might happen to an investigator’s progress if he or she encountered the following situations and you never found out about them? - Co-workers who regularly make fun of spiritual things. - Family members who are strong members of another church. - Friends who believe that the Mormons are a non-Christian cult. - A spiritual experience in reading from the Book of Mormon. Think of a question that you would ask to learn more about each of the situations above. Write your questions in your study journal. Discuss with your companion how you might improve the questions each of you wrote for this activity.', '<3-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ##']","Effective questioning plays a crucial role in enhancing scripture study and understanding of gospel principles by prompting thought, soul searching, and commitment. According to the teachings of the Latter-day Saints, as outlined in the context, good questions help individuals ponder and apply principles, invite the Spirit, and facilitate open communication. They are designed to be simple, easy to understand, and help people think about and apply what they learn. This approach aligns with the guidance to teach for understanding, where expounding the gospel involves explaining doctrines and scriptural passages clearly and simply, relying on the Spirit to guide the teaching. By asking effective questions, teachers can determine how well the investigator understands the teachings and encourage them to share their feelings, thereby discovering a growing testimony. This method is supported by the emphasis on scripture study, where understanding and applying the teachings of the scriptures is paramount, as they contain the word of the Lord as written by prophets of God. Thus, effective questioning is integral to teaching for understanding, as it helps individuals internalize and live gospel principles."

He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world. Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal. The Family of God. All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see Acts 17:26–29; Hebrews 12:9). We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious . . . ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (Alma 31:34–35). “Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message.', '<2-hop>\n\nWork, work, work—there is no satisfactory substitute, especially in missionary work.” – PRESIDENT EZRA TAFT BENSON THE TEACHINGS OF EZRA TAFT BENSON (1988), 200 #### Scripture Study (Page 136) - What does it mean to be diligent? - Moroni 9:6 D&C 10:4, D&C 107:99–100 - Why does the Lord expect you to be diligent? - D&C 75:2–5, D&C 123:12–14, D&C 127:4 - How does diligence relate to agency? - Mosiah 4:26–27, D&C 58:26–29, Topical Guide, “Diligence, Diligent, Diligently” D&C 130:20–21 ## Obedience (Page 136) As a missionary, you are expected to keep the commandments willingly, to obey mission rules, and to follow the counsel of your leaders. Obedience is the first law of heaven. It is an act of faith. You may sometimes be required to do things you do not completely understand. As you obey, you increase in faith, knowledge, wisdom, testimony, protection, and freedom. Strive to be obedient to the Lord, the living prophet, and your mission president. “The discipline contained in daily obedience and clean living and wholesome lives builds an armor around you of protection and safety from the temptations that beset you as you proceed through mortality.” – ELDER L.

How were they blessed? = Alma 56:45–48, Alma 57:21–27 ## Developing Christlike Attributes (Page 136) As you study and seek to develop the attributes described in this chapter and other attributes found in the scriptures, the following pattern may be helpful: - Identify the attribute you wish to develop. - Write a definition and description of the attribute. - Record questions to answer as you study. - List and study thoroughly passages of scripture that teach about the attribute. - Record your feelings and impressions. - Set goals and make plans to apply the attribute in your life. - Pray for the Lord to help you develop the attribute. - Evaluate your progress periodically in developing each attribute. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 137) Identify an attribute from this chapter or from the scriptures. Follow the pattern found above to understand better and to plan for developing the attribute. Look at the image of the name tag. How does your name tag differ from that worn by an employee of a company? Note that the two most prominent parts are your name and the Savior’s name. How can you ensure that you represent the Savior as one of His disciples? Why is it important for people to associate your name with the Savior’s in a positive way? Write your thoughts in your study journal. #### Scripture Study (Page 137) - What are some attributes listed in the scriptures? - Mosiah 3:19, Alma 7:23, D&C 4, D&C 121:41–45, Articles of Faith 1:13, Philippians 4:8, 2 Peter 1:5–8 #### Remember This (Page 137) - You need to be a Christlike missionary, not just do missionary things. - Learning to be like Christ is a lifelong pursuit. - You follow Christ’s example—develop His attributes—one action and decision at a time. - Changing to become Christlike requires exercising faith, repenting, keeping covenants, receiving an increased measure of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 138) ### Personal Study (Page 138) - Prepare a five-minute talk on one of the attributes discussed in this chapter. - Using the Topical Guide, look for ways the Savior has exemplified the attributes described in this chapter. Record what you learn in your study journal. - Periodically complete the “Attribute Activity” at the end of this chapter. - Identify an attribute in this chapter. Ask yourself: - How can I develop this attribute? - What must change in my heart, mind, and actions to develop this attribute? - How will keeping covenants help me develop this attribute? - How will developing this attribute help me qualify for the Holy Spirit and become a more powerful minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - Find examples of Christlike attributes in the lives of men and women in the scriptures. Record your impressions in your study journal. ### Companion Study (Page 138) - Study references to Christlike attributes in the missionary library. - Discuss relationships among different attributes. For example: - How does faith relate to diligence? - In what ways are humility and love related? - How does knowledge strengthen patience? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 138) - Several days before district meeting or zone conference, ask each missionary to select one of the attributes in this chapter or in the scriptures and prepare a five- minute talk on that attribute, including scriptures that have helped him or her. Allow time in the meeting for a few missionaries to share their talks. - Divide the missionaries into three groups, and give them the following assignment: Group 1: Read 1 Nephi 17:7–16 and answer the following questions: - How did Nephi exercise his faith? - What did Nephi do that was Christlike? - What promises did the Lord make to Nephi if he would be faithful and keep the commandments? - How does this account apply to missionary work? Group 2: Read Jacob 7:1–15 and answer the following questions: - Why was Jacob’s faith strong enough to resist Sherem’s attack? - How did Jacob exercise faith when he talked with Sherem? - How were Jacob’s actions Christlike? - What can we do to develop faith like Jacob’s? Group 3: Read Joseph Smith—History 1:8–18, and answer the following questions: - In what ways did Joseph Smith exercise faith in Jesus Christ? - How was his faith tried? - What did he do that was Christlike? - What can we do to follow Joseph Smith’s example? After the groups finish, bring the missionaries together and ask them to share what they discussed. - Share an experience of when you were blessed or inspired by another person’s faith. - Have missionaries refer to the “Attribute Activity. - Page 140” Give each missionary a piece of paper on which to write his or her answers. - When they have completed the worksheet, invite them to set personal goals. - Ask a few of the missionaries to share what they learned and felt as they completed the worksheet. - Share your testimony concerning the importance of developing Christlike attributes. ### Mission President (Page 139) - Ask missionaries to read one of the four Gospels in the New Testament or 3 Nephi 11–28. Have them underline what the Savior did that they can also do. - Use goal setting and planning to teach missionaries about diligence. Show how diligence in focusing on people is an expression of love. - During interviews, ask missionaries to talk about an attribute they are trying to develop. - In a zone conference, invite missionaries to tell about Christlike attributes they admire in their companions. > Beginning of chapter 7 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual #']","Accountability and Christlike attributes are integral to the effectiveness of missionary work as outlined in the 'Preach My Gospel' manual. Accountability is emphasized through the need for missionaries to measure and report their performance, which accelerates improvement and aligns with the teachings of President Thomas S. Monson. This accountability ensures that missionaries focus on their purpose, set goals, and account for their efforts to the Lord and mission leaders. Christlike attributes, on the other hand, are developed through a pattern of identifying, studying, and applying these attributes in one's life. This development is crucial as it transforms missionaries into true disciples of Christ, enabling them to represent the Savior positively and effectively. The manual suggests that learning to be like Christ is a lifelong pursuit that requires faith, repentance, and enduring to the end, which ultimately enhances a missionary's ability to teach and serve others."
"How does missionary language learning contribute to the process of conversion, and what role do key indicators play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 148) - Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language. - Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve. - Select scripture stories or passages you would like to use in teaching. Practice summarizing them in your own words. - Review the ideas in this chapter. Discuss which suggestions you could use in companion study during the next week. - If you are training a new missionary, take note of situations when your companion is not understood. Make a list of relevant words, phrases, or grammar that would help your companion. Explain and practice how to use what is on the list in upcoming, planned activities. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 148) - Invite native speakers to the meeting. Arrange for the missionaries to teach them in small groups. Ask the native speakers to take notes and give feedback on the missionaries’ language. - Assign one or two missionaries ahead of time to tell about successes they have had in studying the language. Have them share their ideas. - Assign an experienced missionary to present briefly some part of the language that is usually difficult for missionaries. Present examples of good usage, and have the missionaries practice them. - Have missionaries who are native to the culture share helpful insights. ### Mission President (Page 149) - Periodically interview missionaries in the language they are learning. - Ask local priesthood leaders for ideas on how missionaries can improve their language. - Identify the most common mistakes made by missionaries learning your mission language.

He wants you to watch over your area with love and great care. Your purpose is to help others come unto Him through baptism and confirmation. Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it. Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you. As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders. Your missionary call letter states: “You will also be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs. As you do these things the Lord will bless you and you will become an effective advocate and messenger of the truth. We place in you our confidence and pray that the Lord will help you meet your responsibilities in fulfilling this sacred assignment.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study Read Jacob 5:11–13, 61–64, 74–75, and answer these questions: - How does the Lord feel about His children? - What kind of effort does the Lord require of His servants? ##', '<2-hop>\n\nKey Indicators for Conversion (Page 152) Perhaps you have wondered which of your many duties are the most important. To be able to answer this question, you must understand your purpose and know how effective use of time can help you fulfill this purpose. Your purpose is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Key indicators have been identified by Church leaders to help you focus on this purpose. As you focus on these indicators, you will help people progress toward baptism, confirmation, continued activity in the Church, and lasting conversion. #### Key Indicators to Record and Report (Page 152) - Investigators baptized and confirmed - Investigators with a baptismal date - Investigators who attend sacrament meeting - Lessons taught to investigators with a member present - Other lessons taught - Progressing investigators - Referrals received and contacted - New investigators - Lessons taught to recent converts and less-active members These indicators identify events and conditions that show a person’s progress toward enduring conversion. A brief description of each key indicator is given below: - Investigators baptized and confirmed: Each person who has received the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. Report baptisms for the week in which they take place and confirmations for the week in which they take place. - Investigators with a baptismal date: Each investigator who has agreed to be baptized and confirmed on specific dates. - Investigators who attend sacrament meeting: Each investigator who has attended sacrament meeting. - Lessons taught to investigators with a member present: The total number of lessons taught to all investigators with a member present. A lesson typically includes the teaching of one or more gospel principles from the lessons, an opening and closing prayer, and invitations to make commitments. It is not necessary to teach all the principles of a lesson to consider it a complete lesson. The effectiveness of your teaching can be measured by whether investigators are growing in their faith in the Savior, repenting of their transgressions, and earnestly preparing to receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. Report only those lessons at which you were present. Report the total number of lessons taught, not the number of investigators who received lessons. - Other lessons taught: The total number of lessons taught to investigators without a member present. - Progressing investigators: The total number of investigators who have been taught two or more lessons and are keeping commitments such as to pray, read from the Book of Mormon, attend church, and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Investigators who are willing to continue learning about the gospel but are struggling to keep commitments are not progressing investigators as defined here. They are classified either as new investigators or other investigators. - Referrals received and contacted: The total number of referrals you have contacted and either taught or asked for a specific return appointment. Once you contact a referral, the referral is moved from the referral pool and either becomes a new investigator, is marked for further follow-up, or is dropped. A referral is also considered contacted if after many attempts you cannot reach the person or you find that the address is incorrect. These referrals are sent back to the mission office with a note describing why contact could not be made. Total referrals received refers to all the referrals you received that have not yet been contacted (referrals from members, investigators, Church headquarters, and so forth). For reporting purposes, the number of referrals that have not yet been contacted carries over from week to week. Each new referral is added to this number and each referral contacted is subtracted from it. Remember, however, that “referrals contacted” refers to the number contacted in the week being reported. - New investigators: The total number of individuals who have received a lesson and accepted a specific return appointment. Lessons taught to recent converts and less-active members: The total number of lessons taught to converts who have been members for less than one year and to less-active members. As you set goals and make plans, evaluate what you do in terms of how your efforts will add to the numbers of people represented in each of these key indicators. Your goal should be to have increasing numbers for every key indicator. You will do many things that are not described in the key indicators, such as street contacting or personal and companion study. These important activities contribute to one or more of the key indicators. For example, when you teach those you find through your own efforts, you add new investigators to your teaching pool. Also, the quality of your personal and companion study will improve your ability to teach by the Spirit, which will bless your new and progressing investigators. The power of your finding and teaching will influence every key indicator. Evaluate all you do based on whether it adds to the numbers of people in these categories. If you and your companion cannot see how a proselyting activity might help increase the numbers of people in one or more key indicators, you need to question whether the activity is worth your time. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 153) In your study journal, list every proselyting activity you have done in the past three days. For each activity, determine if it influenced one of the key indicators. If it did, write yes beside it. If it did not, write no. For each activity with a yes, describe how it had an impact. For each activity with a no, decide why you did it and whether you will continue to do the activity in the future. Discuss your list with your companion, and explain why you marked some activities yes and some activities no. Discuss which activities you may need to stop doing. ## The Area Book and Planning and Reporting']","Missionary language learning contributes to the process of conversion by enabling missionaries to effectively communicate the gospel message, which is essential for teaching and engaging with investigators. In companion study sessions, missionaries practice teaching each other in their mission language, improving pronunciation and summarizing scripture stories, which enhances their ability to convey spiritual insights and gospel principles. This improved communication is crucial for helping investigators progress toward conversion. Key indicators play a significant role in this process by providing measurable goals that focus on the missionary's purpose of inviting others to come unto Christ. These indicators, such as the number of investigators baptized and confirmed, lessons taught, and new investigators, help missionaries track progress and ensure their efforts are aligned with the goal of lasting conversion. By focusing on these indicators, missionaries can evaluate their activities and make informed decisions about how to best use their time to further the Lord's work."
"How can missionaries effectively study and teach the gospel to help others gain faith and repentance, and what role does spiritual knowledge play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\n## Ideas for Study and Application (page 28) ### Personal Study (Page 28) - Prepare a two-minute talk on one of the questions at the beginning of this chapter. Be prepared to share your talk with your companion or with other missionaries in a district meeting. - Ask recent converts to tell their conversion stories. What helped them gain “faith unto repentance” (Alma 34:17)? Why did they decide to be baptized and confirmed? What was it like for them to become new members of the Church? How could missionaries have served them better? - Consider what it means to raise the voice of warning (see Jacob 3:12; D&C 1:4; 38:41; 63:57–58; 88:81; 112:5; Ezekiel 3:17–21; 33:1–12). Write in your own words what it means and how you can go about doing it. - Read Mormon 8 and Moroni 1 and 10. As you read, ask yourself, “What was Moroni’s hope for our day? What did he want us to do with the Book of Mormon? What would I say to Moroni if I had the chance?” Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Consider the events in your life that have strengthened your testimony of Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Then write an answer to this question: What has helped you know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith? ### Companion Study (Page 28) - Share with each other your answers to the questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. - Share with each other what your hopes and desires were for your mission when you received your mission call. To what extent does your experience thus far meet your expectations? How can you meet these expectations more fully? - Read and discuss “Ministry” in the Bible Dictionary. - Select one of the following great missionaries, and read the references listed. As you read, discuss how this missionary (1) understood and committed himself to his calling, (2) demonstrated his attitude and desire for the work, and (3) helped others accept the gospel. - Alma (Mosiah 18) - Aaron (Alma 22; 23:1–6) - Nephi and Lehi (Helaman 5) - Peter (Acts 2) - Paul (Acts 16) - In the hymnbook, select two hymns under the topic “Restoration of the Gospel” (see page 424). Read or sing the hymns. Discuss the meaning of the words. - Read together “Faith,” “Repentance,” “Baptism,” and “Holy Ghost” in the Bible Dictionary. Read and discuss all the scripture references in each entry. - Read together “Dispensations” in the Bible Dictionary. Also read and discuss Doctrine and Covenants 136:37. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 29) - Invite two or three recent converts to share their conversion experiences. How did they feel about the missionaries? about what the missionaries taught? about keeping commitments? What most strongly influenced their conversion? - Invite a priesthood leader to talk to the missionaries about the opportunities and difficulties of building the Church in your area. - Read Alma 18 and discuss these questions: What were Lamoni’s feelings at the beginning of the story? How did they change? What feelings must a person have in order to receive the blessings of the gospel? Read Alma 34:15–16, and compare it with Lamoni’s story. How does Christ’s Atonement enable us to obtain mercy? - Discuss what it means to be a successful missionary. Invite missionaries to give specific examples of success. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Assign one group to read Acts 2:36–38 (Peter), another group to read Acts 16:25–33 (Paul), and the final group to read Mosiah 18:8–11 (Alma). Ask each group to answer the question, “What did this missionary do to help others increase in faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation?” Discuss what the missionaries learn from these stories that could help them exercise faith when inviting people to repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. - Several days before the meeting, assign several missionaries to ponder selected questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. Ask each missionary to prepare a two- to three-minute talk on his or her assigned question. During the district meeting or zone conference, allow the missionaries to give their talks. Following the talks, discuss what they learned and how they could use it in their missionary work. - Divide the missionaries into four groups. Ask each group to list as many truths, covenants, and ordinances as they can that were restored and revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Have each group share their results. Invite missionaries to share how any of the truths revealed through the Restoration has influenced their lives. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 29) 1.

(Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns.']","Missionaries can effectively study and teach the gospel by developing strong study habits that begin with prayer and involve personal engagement with the scriptures and gospel doctrines. This process is an act of faith that requires personal agency and a strong desire to learn. By obtaining spiritual knowledge, missionaries can grow in the gospel and help those they teach to increase their faith in the Savior. The study habits developed as a missionary will not only bless the missionaries personally but also aid in teaching others, helping them to gain 'faith unto repentance' as highlighted in the conversion stories of recent converts. This approach aligns with the guidance to 'seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word,' ensuring that missionaries have the Spirit and the power of God to convince others of the truth of the gospel."

Are they guided by the Holy Ghost? Have you received answers to your prayers? When you pray as companions, do you: – Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness? – Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers? – Pray for people by name and consider their needs? – Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you? – Receive answers to your prayers? - Discuss as companions how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly. - Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost. Write comments that investigators have made about their experiences with the Spirit in learning the gospel and trying to keep commitments. How can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ###', '<2-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 39) 1.

There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction. Preach My Gospel is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district meetings and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrines and principles. We challenge you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children. The First Presidency # Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel? (Page 9) ## Preach My Gospel Use preach my gospel to meets your needs as a missionary. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president. All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study chapter 3, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrines in chapter 3 - To strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony - To teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants. The doctrines in some of the other chapters may also help you teach investigators and new members. For example, chapter 4, “How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?” may help you teach some investigators about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?” may help you resolve an investigator’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon. Preach My Gospel focuses on the fundamentals of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn. Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nThe Missionary Lessons (Page 9) You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the investigator and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nPersonal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes), and prepare for the day. - 7:30 a.m. Breakfast. - 8:00 a.m. Personal study: the Book of Mormon, other scriptures, doctrines of the missionary lessons, other chapters from Preach My Gospel, the Missionary Handbook, and the Missionary Health Guide. - 9:00 a.m. Companion study: share what you have learned during personal study, prepare to teach, practice teaching, study chapters from Preach My Gospel, confirm plans for the day. - 10:00 a.m. Begin proselyting. Missionaries learning a language study that language for an additional 30 to 60 minutes, including planning language learning activities to use during the day. Missionaries may take an hour for lunch and additional study, and an hour for dinner at times during the day that fit best with their proselyting. Normally dinner should be finished no later than 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. Return to living quarters (unless teaching a lesson; then return by 9:30) and plan the next day’s activities (30 minutes). Write in journal, prepare for bed, pray. - 10:30 p.m. Retire to bed. \\*In consultation with the Presidency of the Seventy or the Area Presidency, your mission president may modify this schedule to meet local circumstances. What you learn in personal study will help you in companion study, district meeting, and zone conferences, where you can “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). What you gain from your study sessions and district meetings will help you teach with spiritual power. ### Personal Study (page 10) The purpose of personal study is to strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. In your personal study, focus on the standard works and the approved missionary library: - Jesus the Christ - Our Heritage - Our Search for Happiness - True to the Faith You can make personal study effective as you: - Read from the Book of Mormon and other scriptures. - Study the doctrines of the missionary lessons. - Study other chapters from Preach My Gospel. ### Companion Study (Page 11) The purpose of companion study is to (1) build unity in your companionship in order to teach by the Spirit and (2) focus on the progress of those you teach. You can make companion study effective as you: - Share insights with each other from personal study. - Prepare for specific teaching appointments, member visits, finding opportunities, and other activities. Study material that helps you teach, find, and work more effectively. Discuss the people with whom you are working. Make plans to apply what you are learning. - Throughout the day, continue to discuss the principles, goals, skills, and plans from companion study. ### District Meetings (Page 11) The purpose of district meeting is to “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). - District meetings are held each week for 60 to 90 minutes. - The district leader plans and conducts the district meeting and may invite other missionaries to help teach. - District meetings may include: – Sharing insights from personal and companion study. – Practicing the lessons in various settings. – Explaining, demonstrating, and practicing principles and skills described in Preach My Gospel. – Discussing the progress and needs of investigators. – Discussing and addressing challenges in the district. – Sharing experiences and testimonies of missionary work. - District leaders may use district meeting to receive reports regarding the efforts of missionaries in the district. They should not set goals or quotas for other missionaries.', '<4-hop>\n\nDistrict Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 40) 1. Select a topic from one of the missionary lessons that you have carefully studied. Do the following: – Share two or three main points you learned from your study that were helpful in teaching that lesson. – Describe the way you approached your study that helped you discover these points (how you read, resources you used, questions you were researching, and so on). – Show how you recorded and organized the results of your study. If time permits, ask a few other missionaries to do the same. 2. This activity may be done individually or in small groups. Instruct the missionaries to select one of the following questions (or you may create some of your own questions). Have them write the question down. – Why are families so important in God’s plan? – Why do people have trials and suffering? – What is the role of the Spirit in conversion? Explain that they will have five to seven minutes to: – Find at least two scripture references that answer the question. – Write a simple interpretation of how the scriptures they chose answer the question. – Describe what they would do to remember the answer. – Describe what they would do to explore the question more deeply. Invite a few missionaries (or each group) to share their answers. Discuss their responses. 3. Ask the missionaries to write one or two questions about the gospel principles and doctrines from one of the lessons in chapter 3 for which they would like to find an answer. Invite the missionaries to share their questions with the group. For each question, discuss the following: – How will answering this question bless the life of the missionary? – How will it bless the lives of investigators? – How could a missionary find the answer? 4. Ask several missionaries to share a gospel principle that their companions have taught them. Ask them to explain the principle and how their companion taught it to them. 5. Organize missionaries into companionships or small groups. Assign each group to read one chapter from the Book of Mormon. Have each group select one idea from each of the categories in the section “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Invite the groups to apply each suggestion as they read their chapter together. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for reading and discussion. Have each group explain the suggestions they used, how well the suggestions worked, and what they learned. 6. Invite each missionary to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to him or her (such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites). Invite the missionaries to sketch or describe how they visualize the accounts they have chosen. Invite two or three missionaries to share what they visualize. Ask others to tell the stories and relate them to doctrines in one of the lessons. Read Moroni 10:3 and discuss the value of pondering deeply about spiritual knowledge. ###', '<5-hop>\n\nThe Role of Memorization (Page 44) Memorize scriptures to use in your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal points in each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language should focus their language study on preparing to teach the missionary lessons. They should memorize vocabu- lary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons. ### Teach with Clarity (Page 44) At the end of the first three lessons is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to make the message easy to understand. ### Scripture Study (Page 44) What are you directed to teach? Study Mosiah 18:18–20, D&C 43:15–16 and D&C 52:9 to find the answers to this question. Why must you study the doctrines in the lessons? Study Alma 17:2–3 and D&C 84:85 to find answers to this question. > Lesson One # 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 45) ## Your Purpose (Page 45) As you teach, prepare your investigators to meet the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the baptismal interview questions. This is best accomplished by inviting your investigators to make and keep the commitments listed below. ### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 45) - Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father?']","Spiritual preparation through personal and companion study is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of teaching missionary lessons. Personal study focuses on strengthening a missionary's knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel, which is essential for meeting the needs of those they teach. This involves reading from the Book of Mormon, studying the doctrines of the missionary lessons, and other chapters from 'Preach My Gospel.' Companion study builds unity in the companionship, allowing missionaries to teach by the Spirit and focus on the progress of those they teach. It involves sharing insights from personal study, preparing for teaching appointments, and discussing the people they are working with. District meetings and zone conferences further support this process by providing opportunities to 'teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom' (D&C 88:77). These meetings include sharing insights from personal and companion study, practicing lessons, and discussing the progress and needs of investigators. This collaborative environment helps missionaries teach with spiritual power and apply what they learn effectively in their missionary work."
How can missionaries help less-active members and new converts build their faith in Jesus Christ and engage in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 236) - During ward council meeting, ask the bishop if there are any less-active members in your area he would like you to visit this week. As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for yourself and for others. - Rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Be exactly obedient. • Study the language of your mission each day. - Plan every day and focus on the key indicators. - Work effectively all day, every day. - Ask for referrals from everyone! - Teach when you find; find when you teach. - Read the Book of Mormon with those you teach. - Teach people that an important way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. - Contact every investigator daily. - Bear testimony frequently. - Have a member at every lesson possible. - Always set specific dates and times for the next lesson. - Invite all investigators to baptismal services. - After each lesson, provide investigators with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. - Build relationships with members by serving them and working with the leadership of the ward. - Help ward leaders with retention and activation activities. - Help everyone you teach make commitments that will bring about repentance and will strengthen their faith in the Savior. - Love the Lord and serve Him the very best you can.', '<3-hop>\n\nWe do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven. - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - Faith in Jesus Christ - Repentance - Baptism, Our First Covenant - The Gift of the Holy Ghost - Endure to the End **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)? Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ###', '<4-hop>\n\nMedium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 81) Our message is one of faith and hope. We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)? Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes) (Page 82) - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, into the world (see John 3:16–17). – Only through Christ’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin (see 2 Nephi 2:6–8). – We are responsible to accept Christ, repent, and obey. - Faith in Jesus Christ – We are to believe in Christ as the Savior of the world. – He wants us to accept and follow His teachings. – We receive blessings when we obey (see D&C 130:20–21). - Repentance – Faith in Christ leads to repentance (see Alma 34). – We feel godly sorrow (see 2 Corinthians 7:9–10). – We stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. – We confess our sins, and we confess serious sins to Church leaders, who can help us repent (see D&C 58:43). – We receive forgiveness; guilt and sorrow are replaced by peace (see Alma 36:17–21). - Baptism, Our First Covenant – An ordinance is a sacred rite by which we make covenants with God. – A covenant is a solemn agreement between God and His children. – Keeping covenants brings blessings. – We are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins (see Articles of Faith 1:4). - When we are baptized we begin a new life of commitment to Christ (see Romans 6:3–8). – Baptism must be performed by one holding priesthood authority. – We renew our covenants by partaking of the sacrament weekly (D&C 20:77, 79). - The Gift of the Holy Ghost – Baptism by immersion is followed by baptism of the Spirit; the two are inseparable. – Priesthood holders confer the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. – The Holy Ghost teaches us, cleanses us, comforts us, testifies of the truth, warns us, and directs us (see 2 Nephi 32:1–5; Mosiah 5:1–6; Moroni 10:5; D&C 36:2). - Endure to the End – We must continue on the path once we have been baptized and confirmed. – We do our best to remain free of sin so that we can enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost. – By faithfully following the gospel path of faith, repentance, making and keeping covenants, and receiving the Holy Ghost, we can qualify for eternal life (see 2 Nephi 31:14–20). – We must continually repent throughout our lives (see D&C 19:15–20). **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)? Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 84) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - What does it mean to repent? - Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost an essential part of the gospel? - Why is it important for you to be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?', '<5-hop>\n\nWork, work, work—there is no satisfactory substitute, especially in missionary work.” – PRESIDENT EZRA TAFT BENSON THE TEACHINGS OF EZRA TAFT BENSON (1988), 200 #### Scripture Study (Page 136) - What does it mean to be diligent? - Moroni 9:6 D&C 10:4, D&C 107:99–100 - Why does the Lord expect you to be diligent? - D&C 75:2–5, D&C 123:12–14, D&C 127:4 - How does diligence relate to agency? - Mosiah 4:26–27, D&C 58:26–29, Topical Guide, “Diligence, Diligent, Diligently” D&C 130:20–21 ## Obedience (Page 136) As a missionary, you are expected to keep the commandments willingly, to obey mission rules, and to follow the counsel of your leaders. Obedience is the first law of heaven. It is an act of faith. You may sometimes be required to do things you do not completely understand. As you obey, you increase in faith, knowledge, wisdom, testimony, protection, and freedom. Strive to be obedient to the Lord, the living prophet, and your mission president. “The discipline contained in daily obedience and clean living and wholesome lives builds an armor around you of protection and safety from the temptations that beset you as you proceed through mortality.” – ELDER L. TOM PERRY “CALLED TO SERVE,” ENSIGN, MAY 1991, 39 #### Scripture Study (Page 136) - What does it mean to be obedient? - 1 Nephi 2:3, Mosiah 5:8, Mosiah 15:7 - D&C 82:8–10, Matthew 7:24–27, John 7:17 - John 14:15, Topical Guide, “Obedience, Obedient, Obey” - What can you learn about obedience from these scriptures? - 1 Nephi 3:7, D&C 105:6, 2 Kings 5:1–14 - Why did the young warriors in Helaman’s army obey with exactness? How were they blessed? = Alma 56:45–48, Alma 57:21–27 ## Developing Christlike Attributes (Page 136) As you study and seek to develop the attributes described in this chapter and other attributes found in the scriptures, the following pattern may be helpful: - Identify the attribute you wish to develop. - Write a definition and description of the attribute. - Record questions to answer as you study. - List and study thoroughly passages of scripture that teach about the attribute. - Record your feelings and impressions. - Set goals and make plans to apply the attribute in your life. - Pray for the Lord to help you develop the attribute. - Evaluate your progress periodically in developing each attribute. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 137) Identify an attribute from this chapter or from the scriptures. Follow the pattern found above to understand better and to plan for developing the attribute. Look at the image of the name tag. How does your name tag differ from that worn by an employee of a company? Note that the two most prominent parts are your name and the Savior’s name. How can you ensure that you represent the Savior as one of His disciples? Why is it important for people to associate your name with the Savior’s in a positive way? Write your thoughts in your study journal. #### Scripture Study (Page 137) - What are some attributes listed in the scriptures? - Mosiah 3:19, Alma 7:23, D&C 4, D&C 121:41–45, Articles of Faith 1:13, Philippians 4:8, 2 Peter 1:5–8 #### Remember This (Page 137) - You need to be a Christlike missionary, not just do missionary things. - Learning to be like Christ is a lifelong pursuit. - You follow Christ’s example—develop His attributes—one action and decision at a time. - Changing to become Christlike requires exercising faith, repenting, keeping covenants, receiving an increased measure of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ##', '<6-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 138) ### Personal Study (Page 138) - Prepare a five-minute talk on one of the attributes discussed in this chapter. - Using the Topical Guide, look for ways the Savior has exemplified the attributes described in this chapter. Record what you learn in your study journal. - Periodically complete the “Attribute Activity” at the end of this chapter. - Identify an attribute in this chapter. Ask yourself: - How can I develop this attribute? - What must change in my heart, mind, and actions to develop this attribute? - How will keeping covenants help me develop this attribute? - How will developing this attribute help me qualify for the Holy Spirit and become a more powerful minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - Find examples of Christlike attributes in the lives of men and women in the scriptures. Record your impressions in your study journal. ### Companion Study (Page 138) - Study references to Christlike attributes in the missionary library. - Discuss relationships among different attributes. For example: - How does faith relate to diligence? - In what ways are humility and love related? - How does knowledge strengthen patience? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 138) - Several days before district meeting or zone conference, ask each missionary to select one of the attributes in this chapter or in the scriptures and prepare a five- minute talk on that attribute, including scriptures that have helped him or her. Allow time in the meeting for a few missionaries to share their talks. - Divide the missionaries into three groups, and give them the following assignment: Group 1: Read 1 Nephi 17:7–16 and answer the following questions: - How did Nephi exercise his faith? - What did Nephi do that was Christlike? - What promises did the Lord make to Nephi if he would be faithful and keep the commandments? - How does this account apply to missionary work? Group 2: Read Jacob 7:1–15 and answer the following questions: - Why was Jacob’s faith strong enough to resist Sherem’s attack? - How did Jacob exercise faith when he talked with Sherem? - How were Jacob’s actions Christlike? - What can we do to develop faith like Jacob’s? Group 3: Read Joseph Smith—History 1:8–18, and answer the following questions: - In what ways did Joseph Smith exercise faith in Jesus Christ? - How was his faith tried? - What did he do that was Christlike? - What can we do to follow Joseph Smith’s example? After the groups finish, bring the missionaries together and ask them to share what they discussed. - Share an experience of when you were blessed or inspired by another person’s faith. - Have missionaries refer to the “Attribute Activity. - Page 140” Give each missionary a piece of paper on which to write his or her answers. - When they have completed the worksheet, invite them to set personal goals. - Ask a few of the missionaries to share what they learned and felt as they completed the worksheet. - Share your testimony concerning the importance of developing Christlike attributes. ### Mission President (Page 139) - Ask missionaries to read one of the four Gospels in the New Testament or 3 Nephi 11–28. Have them underline what the Savior did that they can also do. - Use goal setting and planning to teach missionaries about diligence. Show how diligence in focusing on people is an expression of love. - During interviews, ask missionaries to talk about an attribute they are trying to develop. - In a zone conference, invite missionaries to tell about Christlike attributes they admire in their companions. > Beginning of chapter 7 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual #', '<7-hop>\n\nHow Can I Better Learn My Mission Language? (Page 141) #### Consider This (Page 141) - Why must I continually improve my language abilities? - How can I improve my ability to speak and teach in my mission language? - How can I obtain the gift of tongues? ## Prepare Yourself Spiritually (Page 141) The Lord declared, “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power” (D&C 90:11). Strengthen your personal testimony to bring converting power to your words. First study the doctrines and the lessons in your native language. That understanding will strengthen your testimony and your capacity to teach and testify convincingly. You can then learn to express the message of the Restoration in your mission language under the guidance of the Spirit. Listed below are ways you can strengthen your faith that the Lord will help you teach and testify in your mission language: - Recognize that you have been called of God by a prophet. - Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. - Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards. - Pray sincerely for divine assistance. - Study, practice, and use the mission language each day. ## Be Dedicated and Diligent (Page 142) Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort. Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language takes time. Be patient with yourself.']","Missionaries can help less-active members and new converts build their faith in Jesus Christ by visiting them and seeking to strengthen their faith, as suggested during ward council meetings. They can ask these members for referrals, which encourages engagement in missionary work. Additionally, missionaries can work with local priesthood leaders to ensure new converts receive home teachers, prepare names for temple ordinances, and receive lessons with home teachers present. This involvement helps integrate them into the community and strengthens their faith. Furthermore, missionaries are encouraged to teach the gospel principles of faith, repentance, and enduring to the end, which are essential for spiritual growth and maintaining a strong testimony in Jesus Christ."
How can missionaries effectively apply personal learning to their missionary work by using study journals and understanding the broader context of scriptures?,"['<1-hop>\n\n### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 36) Select one of the following references. As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned. - Use this manual as a workbook. Use the space for notes to record impressions and ideas. - Study the scripture passages listed in this manual. Record in this manual or your study journal other scripture passages you have found. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nSee the Big Picture (Page 37) - Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background. - Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph. - Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain. - Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 37) Read the chapter summaries of the books below and write an outline that describes the setting, main events, and main doctrines of each book. - 1 Nephi - Moses - Acts ### Explore the Details (Page 38) - Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions. Examine surrounding words or phrases for clues to what the key words mean. - Look for connecting words, such as therefore, and again, thus, wherefore, and others. Then see how the preceding and following passages relate to each other. - Use the Topical Guide to see how the same word is used in other contexts or how other prophets use the same word. - Look for unfamiliar words or phrases and make sure you understand them. ### Marking Scriptures (Page 38) Marking your scriptures can assist you in thinking deeply about a passage or doctrine of the gospel. You can mark your scriptures in many ways. Find a method that works for you. Below are some guidelines for marking scriptures. - Use pencils or colored markers. Avoid using pens that bleed through the paper. - Shade, underline, bracket, or outline part of a verse, an entire verse, or a group of verses. - Avoid excessive marking. The benefit is lost if you cannot understand your markings because you have made too many notes, lines, and colors. - Underline only a few key words to highlight the verse, section, or chapter. - Circle or underline key words, and then use straight lines to link closely related words. - When a series of points in a verse or passage are related, number the points in the margin or text. - Use the footnotes as a resource for marking and interpreting the scriptures. - Place a symbol (such as a check mark) in the margin for key verses you feel are critical to remember. Marking your scriptures should help you focus on applying what you learn and on teaching others. Develop an approach that is consistent and helps you accomplish your purpose as a missionary. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 38) Which suggestions have you not yet tried? Identify one suggestion from “Study Ideas and Suggestions” to try during your next personal or companion study session. #### Remember This (Page 38) - Pursuing the desire to learn is important to your salvation and your success as a missionary. - You learn the gospel by study, faith, and the power of the Holy Ghost. - Learning is a joy and brings many blessings. - Daily personal and companion study strengthens your faith and your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Use a variety of study methods that make the experience meaningful and enjoyable. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 39) ### Personal Study (Page 39) 1. Rate yourself on the following (1=never, 3=some of the time, and 5=almost always). - I think about the people I am teaching when I study. - Throughout the day I think about what I studied in the morning. - As I study, ideas come to my mind that have not occurred to me before. - I record spiritual impressions and ideas in an appropriate place. - I fall asleep as I study. - I look forward to personal study. - I look forward to companion study. Review your responses. What are you doing well? Do you wish any of your responses were different? Set one or two goals that will improve the quality of your study. 2. Review the “Consider This” questions at the beginning of this chapter. How do these questions influence your study? 3. Review the “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Identify one suggestion from each category that you have not used, and try these ideas during your personal study. 4. Read Doctrine and Covenants 138:1–11. As you read these verses, answer the following questions: – What did President Smith have to do for his mind to be opened? – How did he feel about the doctrine he was thinking about? 5. Read the definition of knowledge in the Bible Dictionary and the references listed. In your study journal, write an answer to the question “What knowledge can help me serve effectively as a missionary?” 6. Select a doctrine from chapter 3 you would like to understand better. Write in your study journal questions you would like to answer. Carefully study that doctrine for a period of time (a few days), and pray specifically for increased understanding. Write what you learn. 7. Read 1 Nephi 10:17; 11:1–6. As you read these verses, answer the question “Why was Nephi able to learn what his father knew?”']","Missionaries can effectively apply personal learning to their missionary work by using study journals to record and organize their insights, as suggested in the 'Use Study Resources' section. This practice helps them frequently review and recall what they have learned, making their study more meaningful and applicable. Additionally, understanding the broader context of scriptures, as outlined in the 'See the Big Picture' section, allows missionaries to grasp the setting, main events, and doctrines of the scriptures they study. By writing outlines and using resources like the Bible Dictionary and chapter summaries, missionaries can gain a comprehensive understanding that enhances their teaching and personal application of gospel principles. These methods encourage missionaries to set goals, evaluate their progress, and make plans for improvement, thereby integrating their learning into their daily missionary efforts."

Read together the following passages. Answer the question “Why should we seek divine light?” - D&C 11:11–14, John 8:12, Psalm 119:105, and D&C 84:43–47. 2. Read together several of the passages below, and discuss blessings that come from studying the word of God. Which passages would best help those you teach? - 1 Nephi 10:19, 2 Nephi 32:3, Mosiah 1:6–7, Alma 17:2–3, Alma 32:42–43, Alma 37:44–46, Alma 49:30, D&C 90:24, D&C 130:19 and TG, “Scriptures, study of” and “Scriptures, value of,” 452–53 ###', '<2-hop>\n\nDistrict Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 40) 1. Select a topic from one of the missionary lessons that you have carefully studied. Do the following: – Share two or three main points you learned from your study that were helpful in teaching that lesson. – Describe the way you approached your study that helped you discover these points (how you read, resources you used, questions you were researching, and so on). – Show how you recorded and organized the results of your study. If time permits, ask a few other missionaries to do the same. 2. This activity may be done individually or in small groups. Instruct the missionaries to select one of the following questions (or you may create some of your own questions). Have them write the question down. – Why are families so important in God’s plan? – Why do people have trials and suffering? – What is the role of the Spirit in conversion? Explain that they will have five to seven minutes to: – Find at least two scripture references that answer the question. – Write a simple interpretation of how the scriptures they chose answer the question. – Describe what they would do to remember the answer. – Describe what they would do to explore the question more deeply. Invite a few missionaries (or each group) to share their answers. Discuss their responses. 3. Ask the missionaries to write one or two questions about the gospel principles and doctrines from one of the lessons in chapter 3 for which they would like to find an answer. Invite the missionaries to share their questions with the group. For each question, discuss the following: – How will answering this question bless the life of the missionary? – How will it bless the lives of investigators? – How could a missionary find the answer? 4. Ask several missionaries to share a gospel principle that their companions have taught them. Ask them to explain the principle and how their companion taught it to them. 5. Organize missionaries into companionships or small groups. Assign each group to read one chapter from the Book of Mormon. Have each group select one idea from each of the categories in the section “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Invite the groups to apply each suggestion as they read their chapter together. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for reading and discussion. Have each group explain the suggestions they used, how well the suggestions worked, and what they learned. 6. Invite each missionary to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to him or her (such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites). Invite the missionaries to sketch or describe how they visualize the accounts they have chosen. Invite two or three missionaries to share what they visualize. Ask others to tell the stories and relate them to doctrines in one of the lessons. Read Moroni 10:3 and discuss the value of pondering deeply about spiritual knowledge. ###', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Role of Memorization (Page 44) Memorize scriptures to use in your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal points in each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language should focus their language study on preparing to teach the missionary lessons. They should memorize vocabu- lary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons. ### Teach with Clarity (Page 44) At the end of the first three lessons is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to make the message easy to understand. ### Scripture Study (Page 44) What are you directed to teach? Study Mosiah 18:18–20, D&C 43:15–16 and D&C 52:9 to find the answers to this question. Why must you study the doctrines in the lessons?

The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 45) ## Your Purpose (Page 45) As you teach, prepare your investigators to meet the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the baptismal interview questions. This is best accomplished by inviting your investigators to make and keep the commitments listed below. ### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 45) - Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father?']","Missionaries can effectively incorporate the concept of 'divine light' into their lessons by engaging in companion study sessions where they read and discuss passages such as D&C 11:11–14, John 8:12, and Psalm 119:105, which emphasize the importance of seeking divine guidance. This approach helps missionaries understand and convey the blessings that come from studying the word of God, as highlighted in the companion study activities. Additionally, memorization plays a crucial role in enhancing the teaching of missionary lessons. Missionaries are encouraged to memorize scriptures and doctrinal points to use in their teaching, ensuring that these elements become personally meaningful. This practice aids in teaching with clarity and helps missionaries prepare to teach effectively, especially when learning a second language. By memorizing vocabulary, phrases, and sentence patterns, missionaries can communicate the lessons more clearly and make the message easy to understand for those they teach."
"How does scripture study contribute to teaching by the Spirit, and what are the guidelines for missionaries to effectively prepare and teach lessons?","['<1-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel? Study 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to find answers to this question. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nStudying and Preparing to Teach the Lessons (Page 33) The lessons (found in chapter 3) contain the baptismal interview questions, commitments and doctrines that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). ####']","Scripture study contributes to teaching by the Spirit by providing missionaries with a deep understanding of the gospel, which is essential for teaching with spiritual power. According to the context, missionaries are encouraged to study scriptures such as 1 Nephi 10:17–19, D&C 11:21–22, D&C 50:19–22, and D&C 88:118 to learn about the gospel. This study helps them to treasure up and apply doctrines in their lives, which in turn strengthens their testimony and ability to teach. The guidelines for missionaries to effectively prepare and teach lessons include seeking and following the Spirit, organizing and summarizing lesson plans, focusing on the needs of those they teach, and preparing to answer questions.

"How can missionaries balance cultural sensitivity with their missionary experiences when communicating with people from home, and what guidelines should they follow to ensure appropriate media use?","['<1-hop>\n\nCommunication with Family, Mission Leaders, and Friends Your family, mission leaders, and friends can be a great support to you on your mission. Communicate on preparation day with your family and people from other areas, including members and those you have taught. Strengthen them as you share spiritual experiences and testimony. When you communicate with other people (besides your family), you should limit your communication to email or letter and not by phone or video chat, unless approved by your mission president. Prioritize your time on preparation day by communicating with your parents first and your mission president second. Be wise in determining the duration of your communication. In making these decisions, be considerate of your companion and keep in mind the purpose of your missionary service. You may read any communications you receive during the week whenever you have appropriate time to do so. You should reply to communications only on preparation day unless it is an emergency (see 3.9.7). > 3.9.1 ### Family You may communicate with your family on your weekly preparation day via letters, emails, text messages, online messaging, phone calls, and video chat. Use the approved communication method that works best for you and your family and that is cost-effective so that you can stay within your monthly budget. This will vary depending on circumstances, location, and schedule. If your parents live in different locations, you may contact each parent separately on preparation day. You also are encouraged to contact your family on other special occasions, such as Christmas, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, your parents’ birthdays, and other holidays that are significant in your home country or culture. You should initiate all text message conversations, online messaging, phone calls, and video chats. If your family needs to contact you, they should contact the mission president first. When communicating with your family by phone or video chat, be wise in determining the duration of your calls. In making these decisions, be considerate of your companion and keep in mind the purpose of your missionary service. > 3.9.2 ### Mission President Write a letter to your mission president weekly on preparation day. Generally, you will submit your letter to him using the Missionary Portal. Only your mission president will review your weekly letter. Be open and honest so that he can understand any concerns you have and provide relevant counsel and feedback. Please be aware that he will read but not be able to respond to every letter. If you receive important news from home that needs immediate attention, inform your mission president and check with him before contacting your family on days other than preparation day or on special occasions. > 3.9.3 ### Communicating with People in Your Mission As you contact people from other areas in your mission, be sure that your communication is focused on fulfilling your missionary purpose. Follow the standards in section 3.5.1, “General Standards for Interacting with Adults,” and in Safeguards for Using Technology, and remember to include your companion as you participate in these communications. > 3.9.4 ### Packages and Letters Some missions may use the mission office address to receive mail and packages and as your return address. This practice can protect your safety and help prevent mail theft and lost mail due to transfers. Please follow all guidelines you receive in such cases. > 3.9.5 ### Missionary Experiences with People from Home You may know a person at home whose personal experience could help someone you are teaching in your mission. You should ask your mission president for permission for that person to share her or his experience and testimony. Counsel with the person about the best communication technology to use. If your family or friends from home want to learn more about the gospel of Jesus Christ, your mission president may allow you to teach them using technology (see 7.5.4). > 3.9.6 ### Personal Visits from Family and Friends Generally, family and friends should not visit you during your mission. However, under special circumstances, your mission president may approve an exception. These visits should be short and not interfere with your missionary duties. A visit should not inconvenience your companion, other missionaries, or the people you teach. Take care that any such visit does not pull your thoughts away from your service or create a financial problem for your family. > 3.9.7 ### Emergencies If your family tells you of an emergency at home, let your mission leaders know so they can give you support. Mission leaders will contact your family if you have an emergency situation. # Physical Well-Being > 4.0 ## Introduction Missionary work requires physical and emotional commitment. The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission. > 4.1 ## Nutrition and Food Preparation Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being. > 4.1.1 ### General Nutrition Guidelines Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below: - Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise. - Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein. - Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food. > 4.1.2 ### Safe Food Preparation Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely: - Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking. - Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use. - Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking. - Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly. - Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats. - Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly. - Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have', '<2-hop>\n\n> 3.6.3 ### Media Choose approved and appropriate media to invite the Spirit and to help you fulfill your missionary purpose. This generally means: - Using social media, mobile apps, and online media that are approved for your mission in teaching the gospel and communicating with your family and friends (see 3.9). - Avoiding television, movies, video games, and unauthorized videos. - Choosing audiobooks, music, and reading material that increase your faith in Jesus Christ. They should be sacred, invite the Spirit, and be uplifting (see General Handbook, 19.1). - Refer to missionary technology standards for more information (see 7.5). Discuss questions about media with your mission leaders. > 3.6.4 ### Musical Instruments If approved by your mission president, you may bring a musical instrument to the mission field. It should be inexpensive, easy to transport, and able to meet baggage requirements. The type of instrument should be appropriate for Sunday meetings (see General Handbook, 19.3.6). You may practice the instrument on preparation day and at other times your mission president designates. When playing the instrument, consider your neighbors and other missionaries and how they may be affected. The type of music you play on the instrument should be sacred, dignified, and suitable for missionary work. > 3.7 ## Photos and Videos Photos can help you share your mission experience with people at home and can be meaningful reminders of your mission. When taking photos or recording videos, be careful not to embarrass anyone, including other missionaries and people who struggle with economic, social, or physical challenges. Some people may not want you or others to see, share, or be reminded of what is shown in a photo. Ask permission before taking and sharing photos or videos. In some missions, you may not be allowed to publicly share photos of anyone you are teaching because of local privacy laws. Taking certain photos may be offensive or illegal in some cultures and places. Some examples include taking photos of: - Certain government and military buildings. - Security areas at airports, passport checks, border crossings, consulates, and embassies. - Law enforcement or military personnel. - People, buildings, or activities of other faiths. - Culturally sensitive subjects, including people in traditional dress. - People struggling with poverty, sickness, or disabilities. - As a general guideline, do not take photos of the objects, places, or people listed above. Discuss any questions you may have with your mission leaders. The Church also has specific policies about taking photographs at meetinghouses: - Do not take pictures or record video in meetinghouse chapels. - Do not photograph, send, or record sacred ordinances, including the sacrament and baptisms and confirmations. > 3.8 ## Use of Technology The Lord declared, “Behold, I will hasten my work in its time” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:73). Technology can be a tool to share teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ and should be used righteously.

However, they must be mindful of cultural sensitivity, especially when taking photos or videos. They should avoid capturing images of culturally sensitive subjects, such as people in traditional dress or those struggling with poverty, sickness, or disabilities. Additionally, missionaries should use approved media to invite the Spirit and fulfill their missionary purpose. This includes using social media, mobile apps, and online media that are approved for their mission, while avoiding unauthorized videos, television, and video games. By adhering to these guidelines, missionaries can maintain cultural sensitivity and use media appropriately in their communications."
"How can missionaries effectively teach the gospel by combining scripture study and teaching by the Spirit, and what role does understanding cultural views of scriptures play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\n#### Cultural Views of Scriptures (Page 195) Most religions have sacred texts or books of scripture, but their use and perception of them may be different from how members of the Church view scriptures. For example, you may need to explain that your marking of scriptures is evidence of your desire to understand and apply the teachings of the scriptures and is not a sign of disrespect. Help those you teach see that the standard works are important because they contain the word of the Lord as written by prophets of God and that we accept them as truth. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 196) Review one of the following passages. Determine how you would: - Introduce the passage. - Provide background and context. - Read the passage and explain its meaning. - Explain difficult words. - Help investigators apply it in their lives.

President James E. Faust said: “Study, ponder, and teach from the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon and the New Testament. Know the truth so well that you can state it clearly. B. H. Roberts wrote, ‘To be known, the truth must be stated and the clearer and more complete the statement is, the better the opportunity will the Holy Spirit have for testifying to the souls of men that the work is true.’ [New Witnesses for God, 3 vols. (1909), 2:vii]. You cannot convert people beyond your own conversion” (“What I Want My Son to Know before He Leaves on His Mission,” Ensign, May 1996, 41). You are commanded to reason with and expound the scriptures when you teach (see D&C 68:1). Expound means to enlarge on and to explain clearly. Expounding the gospel means that you explain the meaning of doctrines and scriptural passages simply and clearly, relying on the Spirit to guide what you say. You use dignified but conversational language to help people understand the doctrinal principle. You ask questions to help them think about the principles and to see if they understand and accept what you have taught. At the end of each of the first three lessons in chapter 3 is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Part of teaching for understanding is to make sure you explain words, phrases, and ideas so that other people understand you better. You can improve your ability to explain the gospel by: - Understanding the words you use. - Defining words others may not understand. Many words that mean special things to members of the Church are defined simply in the Bible Dictionary and True to the Faith. - Asking people questions like, “Do you know what we mean when we say . . . ?” or “Can you restate what we just talked about in your own words?” As you study the doctrine in chapter 3, identify words you think may be difficult for an investigator to understand. As you teach the doctrine in chapter 3, make notes of words, phrases, and ideas that investigators have a hard time understanding. Define those words using the resources mentioned above. Test your definitions with investigators and recent converts. #### Scripture Study (Page 197) - Why should we expound or explain doctrines carefully? - Mosiah 8:3, Mosiah 27:35, D&C 68:1-5 D&C 71:1 - How do we learn?

In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words. Teach so that others will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, desire to repent, and enter into covenants with God. Effective teachers are always working to improve their knowledge and abilities. Although you will not teach all you know about the doctrine, your increased knowledge will build your testimony and your ability to teach with spiritual power. You will know you are using the lessons as intended when you: - Seek and follow the Spirit as you prepare and teach the lessons. - Strive to consistently study, treasure up, and apply the doctrines in your life. - Work with your companion to make specific plans for each person you teach. - Focus on the central messages and doctrines as you teach. - Adjust the order, length, and pace of the lessons to meet the needs of those you teach. - Teach often from the scriptures with clarity and conviction. - Bear testimony frequently. - Help others make and keep commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation. Doing these things will enable you to help others gain a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. As you begin your mission, you will need to learn the organization of the message and acquire the necessary teaching skills. As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language. - **Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.** Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Understand the baptismal interview questions and commitments for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles in your own words with clarity and power. - **Learn and apply the doctrine.** The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lesson, brochures, “Ideas for Teaching,” and missionary library to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries. - **Organize and summarize what to teach.** To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, and examples. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each investigator, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet the needs of those you teach. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience. - **Focus on needs.** While the doctrines of the gospel apply to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation. - **Prepare to answer questions.** As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other materials for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference. - **Teach the lesson.** Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions. - **Evaluate your teaching.** After every teaching situation, evaluate how well you did. Did you focus on the doctrine? Did you invite investigators to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve. As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). ####', '<4-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (page 192) - What does it mean to give “that portion that shall be meted unto every man”? - Alma 29:8, D&C 84:85 - What has the Lord promised faithful missionaries? - D&C 68:2–4, D&C 100:5–8, Matthew 10:19–20 ## Teach with Your Companion in Unity (Page 192) The Lord has commanded, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” (D&C 42:6). Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work together in unity. As you plan and study each day, discuss how you will teach so that you can be united and teach with one voice. Your teaching will be more powerful if you and your companion alternate giving brief portions of the lesson. Avoid falling into a routine when presenting the message. Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths of which he or she has testified. Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something. As companions, be ready to yield to each other so that you do not hinder the guidance of the Spirit. When you speak, maintain eye contact with the investigator. When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the investigator’s responses. #### Scripture Study (Page 193) - How do companions support one another? - Alma 12:1, D&C 42:6, D&C 52:9–10 ## Invite Members to Help You Teach (Page 193) Whenever possible invite members, preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the investigators. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of missionary work. It also provides friendship for the investigator. President Thomas S. Monson taught: *During the teaching process investigators can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new investigators so that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps the second or third visit. Can you appreciate, for example, when missionaries are working with those from the United Church of Canada, the strength of testimony of Brother and Sister William Stoneman, who had come from the United Church of Canada. Brother Stoneman, a printer, would say, “When I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was the lead printer for the United Church. I lost my job. But I found a better job. Even more, I found the truth in its entirety. You too can make the adjustment. You too can make the same decision. In fact, let us pick you up on Sunday morning so that we can sit together in church. Then you can hear and feel for yourself. We’ll be right by your side.” Anthony and Edith Belfiglio became such a fellowshipping couple to those who had Roman Catholic roots. The result was the same. It can be done. And such converts stay converted. In addition, the couples chosen to fulfill this assignment put their own roots even deeper in the rich soil of the gospel. Both Brother Stoneman and Brother Belfiglio became ordained patriarchs. The combined efforts of members and missionaries in such specific cooperation yield an abundant gathering of precious souls (missionary training satellite broadcast, 25 Apr. 2003).* ####']","Missionaries can effectively teach the gospel by combining scripture study and teaching by the Spirit through several key practices. First, they should engage in thorough scripture study to understand the doctrines they are teaching, as highlighted in the context of studying passages like 1 Nephi 10:17–19 and D&C 11:21–22, which emphasize the importance of learning the gospel through the scriptures. This foundational knowledge allows missionaries to teach with clarity and spiritual power, as they are encouraged to expound on the scriptures and explain doctrines simply and clearly, relying on the Spirit to guide their words. Additionally, missionaries are advised to teach in unity with their companions, alternating in delivering portions of the lesson to maintain engagement and support each other, as described in the guidance to teach with one voice and follow spiritual impressions. Understanding cultural views of scriptures is also crucial, as missionaries may need to explain the significance of marking scriptures and the importance of the standard works, which contain the word of the Lord. This understanding helps missionaries address any misconceptions and demonstrate respect for the sacred texts, thereby enhancing their ability to connect with those they teach and help them apply the teachings in their lives."

Answer the following questions in your study journal. - How did Joseph Smith’s reading and pondering of James 1:5 lead him to receive revelation? - What influence did his study have on future generations? - What effect has his decision to study and seek had in your life? - How has your gospel study influenced your life? #### Scripture Study (Page 32) How does the Lord want us to approach gospel study? - Read 2 Nephi 4:15–16, 2 Nephi 32:3, D&C 58:26–28, and D&C 88:118 for answers to the question. ## Learning by the Holy Ghost (Page 32) Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow. This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (1 Nephi 10:19). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (Enos 1:3), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding. Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (D&C 9:7–8). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching. #### Scripture Study (Page 32) What is the Holy Ghost’s role in helping us learn the gospel? Read 2 Nephi 32:5, D&C 11:12-14, John 16:13, Alma 5:45-46, D&C 39:5-6, 1 Corinthians 2:9-14, Moroni 10:5, and John 14:26 to find answers to this question. ## Live What You Learn (Page 33) As you feel the joy that comes from under- standing the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn. Strive to live in harmony with your understanding. Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony. Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17). As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach. The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). > “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior.

According to the context, scripture study involves diligently seeking knowledge, which leads to the mysteries of God being unfolded by the power of the Holy Ghost (1 Nephi 10:19). This study is most effective when guided by the Holy Ghost, who brings knowledge and conviction, increasing faith in Jesus Christ and the desire to repent and improve (Page 32). Teaching by the Spirit requires understanding the lessons thoroughly and teaching in one's own words, focusing on strengthening faith in Jesus Christ and helping others make commitments (Page 33). This approach ensures that the teachings are clear, spiritually powerful, and tailored to the needs of those being taught, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding and application of gospel principles."
How do the guidelines for water and dairy safety and honesty in missionary service contribute to the overall effectiveness of missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\n- Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme. > 4.1.3 ### Water and Dairy Safety Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat. Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission: - Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available. - Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food. - Eat only pasteurized dairy products. - Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe. > 4.2 ## Exercise Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines: - Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights. - If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise. - You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms. > 4.3 ## Stress Management Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying). Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders. If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions. The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17).

In missionary service, this includes: Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health. Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports. Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts. Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion. Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission. > 3.5 ## Interactions with Others The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation. > 3.5.1 ### General Standards for Interacting with Adults Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards: Always stay with your companion. Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president. Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood. Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake. Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions. Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling. > 3.5.2 ### General Standards for Interacting with Children For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines: Always stay with your companion. Never be alone with anyone younger than age 18. Be cautious about playing with groups of children, such as joining a soccer or other game. Do not do anything where your actions might be misinterpreted. Whenever possible, get a parent’s permission to interact with a child. Do not tickle children, change diapers, hold or hug children, or allow children to sit on your lap. These actions could appear inappropriate or be misinterpreted. Politely decline to babysit children of any age. Do not participate in service activities where you would be alone with children (see 7.2.2). > 3.6 ## Recreation You can learn to more fully love the people you serve by taking sincere interest in their culture, history, land, and traditions through visits to local places of interest, generally on preparation day (see 2.5). Ask those you meet to recommend appropriate and safe sites to visit. Choose activities that are uplifting and that help you relax. Appropriate places to visit may include (but are not limited to) the following: Historical and cultural sites Museums and galleries Zoos and parks > 3.6.1 ### General Recreation Standards Avoid gathering as large groups of missionaries in public places. Normally, this means you should not gather in groups larger than the size of your district. Doing so can draw unnecessary attention or make people feel intimidated. Use mission vehicles only for activities that are authorized by your mission president. Exercise and be active to keep your body fit for missionary work. Play sports in ways that avoid injury and extreme fatigue. > 3.6.2 ### Unauthorized Activities Always be safe and use common sense when participating in recreational activities. Because missionaries have been seriously injured while participating in risky activities, you should not participate in activities during your mission that involve increased risk. These activities include but are not limited to the following: - Contact, gymnastic, winter, and water sports (including swimming) - Mountain climbing and rock climbing - Riding on motorcycles and horses - Riding in private boats or airplanes - Handling firearms - Using fireworks or explosives of any kind']","The guidelines for water and dairy safety ensure that missionaries maintain their health by consuming only clean water and pasteurized dairy products, which is crucial for sustaining their physical well-being and ability to perform their duties effectively. This includes using water filters, avoiding unpurified ice and soft drinks, and adhering to mission-specific safety guidelines. On the other hand, honesty in missionary service is vital for building trust and credibility. It involves being truthful in all dealings, especially with mission presidents, and providing accurate reports of work and time management. Together, these guidelines support the overall effectiveness of missionary work by ensuring missionaries are healthy, trustworthy, and reliable, which enhances their ability to engage with and teach others effectively."

As you visit these less-active members, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them for referrals. - Study 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:22. What is the milk that is referred to? What is the meat? Compare your answers with the doctrines in the chapter “What Should I Study and Teach?” Why must you provide the milk and the meat in the right sequence and in the right amount? How do you do that? - Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism: *“The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. . . . This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed. [1939], 96).* Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism: *“Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (Gospel Doctrine, 96).* - What did you personally learn from President Smith about your own testimony and commitment to live the gospel? - What did you learn about the difficulties that new converts, even future prophets, face following baptism? - Thinking of recent converts and less-active members, what can you do to help them regain the “desire and purpose” they once had? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 237) - Invite a bishop to talk about the challenges of working with less-active members and new converts. Ask him to emphasize how missionaries can help with these challenges. - Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see Luke 15). ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 237) - Work with local priesthood leaders to encourage them to help new converts: - Be ordained to the priesthood. - Receive home teachers. - Prepare the name of an ancestor to take to the temple and to perform baptisms for the dead. - Receive the “Laws and Ordinances” lesson with home teachers present. - Teach local leaders how to use missionaries in ward council. - Teach local leaders the purpose and uses of the Progress Record. - Occasionally ask missionaries to show you a copy of their Progress Record. - Occasionally follow up with recent converts to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can be of help. - Invite stake or ward leaders to speak to your missionaries to explain how the missionaries can be of greatest help. - Invite recent converts to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences as new members of the Church. - Occasionally ask members who are converts to share their conversion experience in a zone conference. ### Remember This (Page 243) - Your purpose is to bring souls to Christ. - Prepare people to meet the qualifications for baptism in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and the baptismal interview questions. - Pray often for yourself and for others. - Rely on the Spirit to show you where to go, what to do, and what to say. - Be exactly obedient. • Study the language of your mission each day. - Plan every day and focus on the key indicators. - Work effectively all day, every day. - Ask for referrals from everyone! - Teach when you find; find when you teach. - Read the Book of Mormon with those you teach. - Teach people that an important way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon. - Contact every investigator daily. - Bear testimony frequently. - Have a member at every lesson possible. - Always set specific dates and times for the next lesson. - Invite all investigators to baptismal services. - After each lesson, provide investigators with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. - Build relationships with members by serving them and working with the leadership of the ward. - Help ward leaders with retention and activation activities. - Help everyone you teach make commitments that will bring about repentance and will strengthen their faith in the Savior. - Love the Lord and serve Him the very best you can.', '<3-hop>\n\nWe do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 81) The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven. - Through Christ We Can Be Cleansed from Sin - Faith in Jesus Christ - Repentance - Baptism, Our First Covenant - The Gift of the Holy Ghost - Endure to the End **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)? Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ###', '<4-hop>\n\nMedium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 81) Our message is one of faith and hope. We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

Will you be confirmed and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Questions to Ask after You Teach (Page 84) - What questions do you have about what we have taught? - What does it mean to repent? - Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost an essential part of the gospel? - Why is it important for you to be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?', '<5-hop>\n\nWork closely with the bishop and the ward mission leader to make sure this essential ordinance is performed. ## After the Baptism and Confirmation (Page 224) Under the direction of the bishop, missionaries may continue to fellowship new members. Continue to teach them and review what they have been taught. Encourage and support them, read the Book of Mormon with them, and help them share the gospel with family members and friends. As appropriate, continue throughout your life to communicate with those whom you have taught and to encourage and support them. After the confirmation, continue using the Teaching Record to record your progress in teaching lessons 1–4 again and in teaching lesson 5. Work closely with the ward mission leader and ward leadership to help the new convert stay active and receive all the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. #### Remember This (Page 224) - Properly prepare baptismal candidates for the interview for baptism and confirmation. - Make sure candidates meet the requirements for baptism and confirmation. - Help ensure that baptismal services are spiritually uplifting. - Use baptismal services and confirmations as finding opportunities. - Accurately complete baptismal and confirmation forms. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 225) ### Personal Study (Page 225) - Make a list of the challenges that a baptismal candidate might encounter. Why is it important that candidates feel the love and friendship of Church members? - Study Moroni 6 and Doctrine and Covenants 20:68–69. What do you learn from these verses about preparing people for baptism and confirmation? Write what you learn, and share your thoughts with your companion during companion study. ###', '<6-hop>\n\nCompanion Study (Page 225) - Elder Henry B. Eyring explained why high standards are important. Discuss this counsel with your companion and evaluate how you feel about boldly helping people meet these standards. “The Lord sets His standards so that He can bless us. Think about those blessings: He promises those who meet the standards the help of the Holy Ghost. He promises personal peace. He promises the chance to receive holy ordinances in His house. And He promises those who endure in living His standards that they will have eternal life. . . . Because we love the people we serve, all of us want to do better in lifting our Heavenly Father’s children to the faithfulness and purity they need to have all the blessings of the Lord. . . . You begin by holding up the Lord’s standards clearly and without apology. And the more the world drifts from them and mocks them, the bolder we must be in doing that” (“Standards of Worthiness,” First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, Jan. 2003, 10–11). - Share with your companion what you have learned from this chapter about preparing people for baptism and confirmation. - Review the last baptismal service you attended. Compare it with the guidelines in the section titled “The Baptismal Service.” What went well? What could have been improved? Discuss how you will make sure that the services you plan will be spiritual and uplifting. - Practice how you would prepare a specific investigator for the baptismal interview. - Review the baptismal interview questions. Consider how you would handle different situations, such as the following: - The candidate didn’t tell you that he is on probation for a crime previously committed. - The person has not received a strong answer to prayer that Joseph Smith was a prophet. - The candidate smoked a cigarette two days ago. - The candidate isn’t sure whether she has received an answer to her prayers. - The family felt pressure from friends and aren’t sure whether they are ready for baptism. - Review the Baptism Record and Confirmation Record form and the Baptism and Confirmation Certificate form. How can you ensure that the information you provide is correct and complete? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 226) - Review the importance of the baptismal interview. Discuss how missionaries should prepare investigators for the interview. - Discuss how to use baptismal services and confirmations as finding opportunities. ### Mission President (Page 226) - Work with local priesthood leaders to ensure effective use of the Progress Record. - Occasionally conduct a first interview for baptism. - Teach district leaders and zone leaders how to conduct baptismal interviews. - Instruct the members of the mission presidency and priesthood leaders how to conduct baptismal interviews for baptismal candidates who have committed serious sins. > Beginning of chapter 13 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Work with Stake and Ward Leaders? (Page 227) #### Consider This (Page 227) - What do new converts and less-active members need in order to become active members of the Church? - What are the responsibilities of stake and ward leaders in missionary work, retention, and activation? - How can I help ward leaders establish the Church? - What should happen in the weekly correlation meeting with the ward mission leader? ## Overview You have the great opportunity of working with many leaders and members during your mission. Together you will strengthen and establish The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The relationships you establish with Church leaders will bless you for the rest of your life. These are important relationships as you and Church members seek to bring the restored gospel to Heavenly Father’s children. Understanding the basics of how to work within the ward organization will help you move forward with greater focus and power. ##', '<7-hop>\n\nStrengthening New and Less-Active Members (Page 227) When converts are baptized and confirmed, they make sacred promises to obey and serve God and others for the rest of their lives. They become candidates for salvation in the celestial kingdom. To receive the promised blessings, they must endure to the end with faith in Jesus Christ. Church members are essential in helping new converts remain active and faithful. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: “There is absolutely no point in doing missionary work unless we hold on to the fruits of that effort. The two must be inseparable. . . . Every convert is a great and serious responsibility” (“Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,” Ensign, May 1999, 108). Under the direction of the bishop, the ward council has first responsibility for strengthening new members and less-active members. They make sure that new converts and less-active members have friends, are nourished by the word of God, and receive callings and responsibilities. They may request that full-time missionaries help in home teaching (or sister missionaries with visiting teaching) and in visiting new members, less- active members, and prospective elders. Preferably you will be paired with a member for such visits. You are also responsible for these people. President Hinckley said: “You missionaries . . . are part of this responsibility of binding your converts to the Church. You may not be able to continue to visit them. But you can write to them occasionally and give them encouragement. . . . When you go home do not forget them. At all times live worthy of their trust. Write to them occasionally, assuring them of your love” (Ensign, May 1999, 109). When attending church meetings, you and your companion should sit with your investigators or members you have been fellowshipping to support and strengthen them. You should not sit in a group with other missionaries. A vital part of your mission is to establish the Church and strengthen the unit in which you serve. You do this in part by helping new converts remain active and by helping less-active members return to activity. One of your duties is to join with ward missionaries to teach again the first four lessons and to teach lesson 5. Ward missionaries, home teachers, and visiting teachers can also help teach these principles. President Gordon B. Hinckley related the following concerning the challenges many new converts face: *I received the other day a very interesting letter. It was written by a woman who joined the Church a year ago. She writes: “My journey into the Church was unique and quite challenging. This past year has been the hardest year that I have ever lived in my life. It has also been the most rewarding. As a new member, I continue to be challenged every day.” She goes on to say that when she joined the Church she did not feel support from the leadership in her ward. Her bishop seemed indifferent to her as a new member. Rebuffed, as she felt, she turned back to her mission president, who opened opportunities for her. She states that “Church members don’t know what it is like to be a new member. . . . Therefore, it’s almost impossible for them to know how to support us.” I challenge you, my brothers and sisters, that if you do not know what it is like, you try to imagine what it is like. It can be terribly lonely. It can be disappointing. It can be frightening. We of this Church are far more different from the world than we are prone to think we are. This woman goes on: “When we as investigators become members of the Church, we are surprised to discover that we have entered into a completely foreign world, a world that has its own traditions, culture, and language. We discover that there is no one person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration and anger that we leave.']","Faith in Jesus Christ is fundamental for new converts and less-active members to regain their spiritual commitment and endure to the end. As outlined in the context, faith in Christ leads to repentance and a desire to follow His teachings, which includes making and keeping covenants such as baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost. This faith is nurtured through continual learning about the gospel, prayer, and reliance on the Spirit, which helps individuals remain free from sin and enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Missionary work plays a crucial role in this process by providing support and encouragement to new converts and less-active members. Missionaries, working closely with local priesthood leaders and ward members, help these individuals by teaching them the gospel, involving them in church activities, and encouraging them to share the gospel with others. This collaborative effort ensures that new converts and less-active members feel supported and integrated into the church community, helping them to endure to the end and qualify for eternal life."
"How do the essential doctrines and principles taught by missionaries contribute to their success, and what role do these teachings play in the conversion experiences of new members?","['<1-hop>\n\n## Ideas for Study and Application (page 28) ### Personal Study (Page 28) - Prepare a two-minute talk on one of the questions at the beginning of this chapter. Be prepared to share your talk with your companion or with other missionaries in a district meeting. - Ask recent converts to tell their conversion stories. What helped them gain “faith unto repentance” (Alma 34:17)? Why did they decide to be baptized and confirmed? What was it like for them to become new members of the Church? How could missionaries have served them better? - Consider what it means to raise the voice of warning (see Jacob 3:12; D&C 1:4; 38:41; 63:57–58; 88:81; 112:5; Ezekiel 3:17–21; 33:1–12). Write in your own words what it means and how you can go about doing it. - Read Mormon 8 and Moroni 1 and 10. As you read, ask yourself, “What was Moroni’s hope for our day? What did he want us to do with the Book of Mormon? What would I say to Moroni if I had the chance?” Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Consider the events in your life that have strengthened your testimony of Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Then write an answer to this question: What has helped you know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith? ### Companion Study (Page 28) - Share with each other your answers to the questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. - Share with each other what your hopes and desires were for your mission when you received your mission call. To what extent does your experience thus far meet your expectations? How can you meet these expectations more fully? - Read and discuss “Ministry” in the Bible Dictionary. - Select one of the following great missionaries, and read the references listed. As you read, discuss how this missionary (1) understood and committed himself to his calling, (2) demonstrated his attitude and desire for the work, and (3) helped others accept the gospel. - Alma (Mosiah 18) - Aaron (Alma 22; 23:1–6) - Nephi and Lehi (Helaman 5) - Peter (Acts 2) - Paul (Acts 16) - In the hymnbook, select two hymns under the topic “Restoration of the Gospel” (see page 424). Read or sing the hymns. Discuss the meaning of the words. - Read together “Faith,” “Repentance,” “Baptism,” and “Holy Ghost” in the Bible Dictionary. Read and discuss all the scripture references in each entry. - Read together “Dispensations” in the Bible Dictionary. Also read and discuss Doctrine and Covenants 136:37. ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 29) - Invite two or three recent converts to share their conversion experiences. How did they feel about the missionaries? about what the missionaries taught? about keeping commitments? What most strongly influenced their conversion? - Invite a priesthood leader to talk to the missionaries about the opportunities and difficulties of building the Church in your area. - Read Alma 18 and discuss these questions: What were Lamoni’s feelings at the beginning of the story? How did they change? What feelings must a person have in order to receive the blessings of the gospel? Read Alma 34:15–16, and compare it with Lamoni’s story. How does Christ’s Atonement enable us to obtain mercy? - Discuss what it means to be a successful missionary. Invite missionaries to give specific examples of success. - Divide the missionaries into three groups. Assign one group to read Acts 2:36–38 (Peter), another group to read Acts 16:25–33 (Paul), and the final group to read Mosiah 18:8–11 (Alma). Ask each group to answer the question, “What did this missionary do to help others increase in faith in Christ, repent, and receive baptism and confirmation?” Discuss what the missionaries learn from these stories that could help them exercise faith when inviting people to repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. - Several days before the meeting, assign several missionaries to ponder selected questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter. Ask each missionary to prepare a two- to three-minute talk on his or her assigned question. During the district meeting or zone conference, allow the missionaries to give their talks. Following the talks, discuss what they learned and how they could use it in their missionary work. - Divide the missionaries into four groups. Ask each group to list as many truths, covenants, and ordinances as they can that were restored and revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Have each group share their results. Invite missionaries to share how any of the truths revealed through the Restoration has influenced their lives. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nWhat Do I Study and Teach? (Page 43) The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrines, principles, and commandments that you are to study, believe, love, live, and teach. They are what the living prophets and apostles have directed you to teach. They are organized so that you can help others clearly understand the doctrines of Christ. The lessons in this chapter are: 1. The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 2. The Plan of Salvation 3. The Gospel of Jesus Christ 4. The Commandments 5. Laws and Ordinances Teach the first four lessons before baptism. Make sure those you teach qualify for baptism and confirmation by making and keeping all of the commitments in these lessons. Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching lessons before baptism with the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, new members are taught the first four lessons again, as well as “Laws and Ordinances.” Ward leaders determine whether ward missionaries or full-time missionaries lead out in ensuring that these lessons are taught and how long full-time missionaries are involved. Encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons. You should also use these lessons in individual and companion study, district meetings, and other training settings. As you study the scriptures and treasure up in your mind the doctrines in these lessons, the Spirit will give you in the very hour what you should say and do to help others receive a witness of the truthfulness of the teachings. As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and prepare to teach, keep firmly in mind these instructions. Make sure that you teach all the doctrines in these lessons. Unless directed by the Spirit, for each of the first three lessons, you should give the full content in the order in which they are written. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Each lesson outlines the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrines that you are to teach. Thoroughly learn the doctrines. Consistently focus on helping those you teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview questions to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation. The lessons also have ideas for teaching. Use these suggestions to strengthen how you prepare and teach. ###']","The essential doctrines and principles taught by missionaries, as outlined in the lessons such as 'The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,' 'The Plan of Salvation,' 'The Gospel of Jesus Christ,' and 'The Commandments,' are crucial for missionary success. These teachings help ensure that those being taught understand the doctrines of Christ and are prepared for baptism and confirmation by making and keeping commitments. The lessons are designed to be taught before baptism and revisited after, ensuring new members fully grasp the teachings. This structured approach, guided by the Spirit, allows missionaries to teach from the heart, fostering a deeper connection and understanding. The conversion experiences of new members are significantly influenced by these teachings, as they provide a foundation for faith, repentance, and commitment to the gospel, which are essential for a successful missionary effort."
How do prayer and the Book of Mormon work together to facilitate spiritual growth and conversion according to Latter-day Saint teachings?,"['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 115) - Talk about the prayers you offer as companions. Are they guided by the Holy Ghost? Have you received answers to your prayers? When you pray as companions, do you: – Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness? – Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers? – Pray for people by name and consider their needs? – Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you? – Receive answers to your prayers? - Discuss as companions how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly. - Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost. Write comments that investigators have made about their experiences with the Spirit in learning the gospel and trying to keep commitments. How can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 116) - Occasionally ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you. - In interviews, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers.

(Page 117) #### Consider This - How is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion? - How does the Book of Mormon answer the great questions of the soul? - Why is the Book of Mormon so powerful in the conversion process? - How should I use the Book of Mormon to build faith and help others to draw closer to God? - Why is the promise in Moroni 10:3–5 central in missionary work? ## Overview (Page 117) The Book of Mormon is powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching. ##', '<3-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion (Page 117) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (History of the Church, 2:52). An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge- shaped pieces that lean against each other. The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways: - Witness of Christ. “The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.” - Fulness of doctrine. “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (D&C 20:9 [;27:5].) . . . In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation. And they are taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.” - Foundation of testimony. “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” (A Witness and a Warning [1988], 18–19). The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach investigators. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach investigators. | Missionary Lesson | Doctrines | References | | --- | --- | --- | | The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ | Apostasy, Restoration, Joseph Smith, priesthood authority | 1 Nephi 12-14 2 Nephi 3; 26-29 Mosiah 18 | | The Plan of Salvation | The “great plan of the eternal God,” including the Fall of Adam, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the Judgment | 2 Nephi 2; 9 Mosiah 3; 15 Alma 12; 40-42 | | The Gospel of Jesus Christ | Faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end | 2 Nephi 31-32 3 Nephi 11; 27 | | The Commandments; Laws and Ordinances | Ordinances such as baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament | 3 Nephi 11:22-28; 18 Moroni 2-6 |', '<4-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##', '<5-hop>\n\nIdeas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","In Latter-day Saint teachings, prayer and the Book of Mormon are integral to spiritual growth and conversion. Prayer is seen as a two-way communication with God, where individuals express gratitude, seek guidance, and ask for confirmation of spiritual truths. The Book of Mormon is considered the keystone of the religion, providing powerful evidence of the divinity of Christ and the Restoration through Joseph Smith. It is believed that by reading and pondering the Book of Mormon and praying with a sincere heart, individuals can receive a witness from the Holy Ghost of its truthfulness. This process of prayer and study helps individuals build faith, recognize the Spirit's influence, and draw closer to God, ultimately leading to conversion and spiritual growth."
How do the teachings in 2 Nephi 9:24 and 2 Nephi 2:26–29 guide missionaries in their efforts to endure to the end and be accountable in their service?,"['<1-hop>\n\nWe do so by continually exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit. Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes.

He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world. Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal. The Family of God. All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see Acts 17:26–29; Hebrews 12:9). We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious . . . ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (Alma 31:34–35). “Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (D&C 42:8). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message.']","The teachings in 2 Nephi 9:24 emphasize the importance of enduring to the end as part of the gospel path, which includes faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost. This lifelong commitment is essential for missionaries as they strive to remain free from sin and grow in Christlike attributes, ultimately qualifying for eternal life. Meanwhile, 2 Nephi 2:26–29 highlights the significance of agency in accountability, teaching that individuals are free to choose liberty and eternal life through the Savior. For missionaries, this means they must exercise their agency responsibly, setting goals and making plans that align with their purpose to help others progress in the gospel. By doing so, they can effectively fulfill their roles and be accountable to the Lord and mission leaders, as emphasized in the guidance for missionary work."
How does the teaching of Moses 5:8 about prayer relate to the role of prophets in revealing the gospel in every dispensation?,"['<1-hop>\n\nThe Gospel Blesses Families (Page 46) The restored gospel blesses and helps husbands and wives, parents and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and spiritual strength in their families. These blessings are available now and in eternity. The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current concerns and challenges. Because families are ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in eternity. God has established families to bring happiness to His children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere, and prepare them for eternal life. The home is the best place to teach, learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing family members with peace, joy, and happiness. Through prophets in every age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for individuals and families. > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation (Page 46) One important way that God shows His love for us is by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the power and authority given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation. They in turn teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer. The teachings of prophets are found in sacred books called scriptures. Our Father’s plan for us to be successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus’ Atonement at the center of that plan. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can receive eternal life if we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. “This is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:21). All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to accept or reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles. Those who choose to obey are blessed, but those who ignore, reject, or distort the gospel do not receive God’s promised blessings. Whenever people choose to disregard, disobey, or distort any gospel principle or ordinance, whenever they reject the Lord’s prophets, or whenever they fail to endure in faith, they distance themselves from God and begin to live in spiritual darkness. Eventually this leads to a condition called apostasy. When widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority to teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel. Biblical history has recorded many instances of God speaking to prophets, and it also tells of many instances of apostasy. To end each period of general apostasy, God has shown His love for His children by calling another prophet and giving him priesthood authority to restore and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ anew. In essence, the prophet acts as a steward to oversee the household of God here on earth. Such periods of time headed by prophetic responsibility are called dispensations. God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to Adam and gave him priesthood authority. Adam was the first prophet on the earth. By revelation, Adam learned of mankind’s proper relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Adam and Eve taught their children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel in all aspects of their lives. Adam was followed by other prophets, but over time the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel and fell into apostasy, choosing to be unrighteous. Thus began the pattern of prophetic dispensations that makes up much of the recorded history of the Old Testament. Heavenly Father revealed His gospel through direct communication to prophets such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Each prophet was called by God to begin a new dispensation of the gospel. To each of these prophets God granted priesthood authority and revealed eternal truths. Unfortunately, in each dispensation people eventually used their agency to choose to reject the gospel and then fell into apostasy. ### Prophets (Page 48) Determine what the person you are teaching understands about prophets. In most cultures there are people who believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God as defined in the restored gospel. Explain clearly that God establishes His kingdom on the earth by calling a prophet to establish a new dispensation. He gives that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. You might wonder how gospel dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people understand that God loves His children and that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.', '<2-hop>\n\nPray Often (Page 87) God commands us to pray to Him. You can pray at any time and in any setting. The Lord has taught us to kneel and pray in the morning and in the evening, as individuals and with our families. Our Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. Through daily prayer we receive divine guidance and blessings. We should always pray sincerely. We should also pray with “real intent,” which means we are committed to act on the answer that we receive. We pray with faith to our Father in Heaven in the name of Jesus Christ (see Moses 5:8). Because He is our Father and we are His children, He will answer our prayers. We begin our prayers by addressing our Father in Heaven. We end our prayers by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.” In prayer we speak openly and honestly with our loving Father in Heaven. We express gratitude and thanksgiving for our blessings. We may acknowledge our love for Him. We also ask for help, protection, and direction according to our needs. As we pray with faith, sincerity, and real intent, we will see God’s influence in our lives. He will guide us in our daily lives and help us make good decisions. He will bless us with feelings of comfort and peace. He will warn us of danger and strengthen us to resist temptation. He will forgive our sins. We will feel closer to Him. We must learn to recognize His influence in our lives. We must learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Spirit. We can recognize when the Holy Ghost is teaching us the truth. Our minds will be filled with inspiring and uplifting thoughts. We will be enlightened, or given new knowledge. Our hearts will have feelings of peace, joy, and love. We will want to do good and be helpful to others. These feelings are hard to describe but can be recognized as we experience them. #### Scripture Study (Page 87) | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 2 Nephi 32:8-9 | D&C 6:22-23 | D&C 19:28 | | Enos 1:1-12 | D&C 8:2-3 | 1 Kings 19:11-12 | | Alma 34:17-28 | D&C 9:7-9 | Bible Dictionary, “Prayer” | | Moroni 10:3-5 | | | **Commitment** - Will you kneel and pray daily as individuals and as a family? ## Study the Scriptures (Page 87) The scriptures are written records of God’s dealings with His children as recorded by prophets under the influence of the Holy Ghost. We show our faith by studying, believing, and obeying God’s revealed word. We diligently search the scriptures to understand the truth. We feast upon them because they open the door to revelation and show us what we need to do and become. We search the scriptures to learn about Jesus Christ and His gospel. Faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from God and comes through studying and living His word and His gospel. The approved scriptures of the Church, also called the standard works, are the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. We should study these sacred books daily. #### Scripture Study (Page 88) | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 Nephi 19:22-23 | 2 Nephi 31:19-20 | John 20:31 | | 2 Nephi 9:50-51 | 2 Nephi 32:3-5 | 2 Timothy 3:14-17 | | 2 Nephi 25:26 | Alma 32:28-30 | 2 Peter 1:20-21 | | 2 Nephi 29:1-13 | John 5:39 | | **Commitment** - Will you read the scriptures daily as individuals and as a family?']","Moses 5:8 emphasizes the importance of praying with faith and sincerity, which is a way to receive divine guidance and blessings. This teaching relates to the role of prophets in revealing the gospel in every dispensation, as prophets are called by God to communicate His will and guide His children. Through prayer, individuals can receive personal revelation and guidance, complementing the teachings and revelations given through prophets. Prophets, like Moses, are instrumental in establishing new dispensations of the gospel, and prayer is a means for individuals to connect with God and receive confirmation of the truths taught by these prophets."

How does the principle found in 1 Nephi 3:7 relate to the process of learning a mission language and the importance of diligence in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\n- Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. - Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards. - Pray sincerely for divine assistance. - Study, practice, and use the mission language each day. ## Be Dedicated and Diligent (Page 142) Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort. Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language takes time. Be patient with yourself. Seek the help of your companion, members, investigators, and other missionaries. Do not stop improving your language skills once people begin to understand you. As your ability to speak the language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it. You will be less worried about how to communicate the feelings that are in your heart. You will be better able to respond to the needs of investigators and the promptings of the Spirit. Strive to master the language throughout your mission and after you return. The Lord has invested much in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your life. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained: “We would . . . hope that every missionary learning a new proselyting language would master it in every way possible. . . . And as you do so, your proselyting and testifying skills will improve. You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive to your investigators. . . . Don’t be satisfied with what we call a missionary vocabulary only. Stretch yourself in the language, and you will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (missionary satellite broadcast, Aug. 1998). You are not alone in learning your mission language. Whenever the Lord gives a commandment, He provides a way to accomplish it (see 1 Nephi 3:7). Seek His help. Be dedicated in your study. In time you will acquire the language skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. ## Learn English (Page 142) If you do not speak English, you should study it as a missionary. This will bless you during your mission and throughout your life. Learning English will enable you to help build the Lord’s kingdom in additional ways and will be a blessing for you and your family. Many of the suggestions found in this chapter will help you. Focus particularly on the following: - Set a goal to speak English with your companion. If your companion already knows English and is trying to learn your language, you might choose to speak English in the apartment and the mission language when you go out. - With your companion, read from the Book of Mormon in English. You might also choose to alternate: You read a verse in English, and then your companion reads a verse in the mission language. Correct each other’s pronunciation and intonation. - Ask your mission president for suggestions on a simple English grammar text if you do not already have one. ## Principles of Language Learning (Page 142) This section describes principles to help you study and learn the language more effectively. - **Take responsibility.** Regularly create or adjust your language learning goals and study plan. Strive to use the language at every opportunity. - **Make your study meaningful.** Ask yourself: Why am I studying this? How will it help me communicate better? Relate what you study to real-life situations and daily activities. Study parts of the language that will help you say what you want to say. For example, if there is a scripture story you would like to include in your teaching, learn the vocabulary and grammar necessary to relate it. - Seek to communicate. Seek to find an appropriate balance between studying grammar and the structure of the language and learning through your daily activities. There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language. - Learn new concepts thoroughly. You will be able to recall and effectively use language principles if you review regularly what you have studied and if you practice again in new situations. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nWork, work, work—there is no satisfactory substitute, especially in missionary work.” – PRESIDENT EZRA TAFT BENSON THE TEACHINGS OF EZRA TAFT BENSON (1988), 200 #### Scripture Study (Page 136) - What does it mean to be diligent? - Moroni 9:6 D&C 10:4, D&C 107:99–100 - Why does the Lord expect you to be diligent? - D&C 75:2–5, D&C 123:12–14, D&C 127:4 - How does diligence relate to agency? - Mosiah 4:26–27, D&C 58:26–29, Topical Guide, “Diligence, Diligent, Diligently” D&C 130:20–21 ## Obedience (Page 136) As a missionary, you are expected to keep the commandments willingly, to obey mission rules, and to follow the counsel of your leaders. Obedience is the first law of heaven. It is an act of faith. You may sometimes be required to do things you do not completely understand. As you obey, you increase in faith, knowledge, wisdom, testimony, protection, and freedom. Strive to be obedient to the Lord, the living prophet, and your mission president. “The discipline contained in daily obedience and clean living and wholesome lives builds an armor around you of protection and safety from the temptations that beset you as you proceed through mortality.” – ELDER L.

How were they blessed? = Alma 56:45–48, Alma 57:21–27 ## Developing Christlike Attributes (Page 136) As you study and seek to develop the attributes described in this chapter and other attributes found in the scriptures, the following pattern may be helpful: - Identify the attribute you wish to develop. - Write a definition and description of the attribute. - Record questions to answer as you study. - List and study thoroughly passages of scripture that teach about the attribute. - Record your feelings and impressions. - Set goals and make plans to apply the attribute in your life. - Pray for the Lord to help you develop the attribute. - Evaluate your progress periodically in developing each attribute. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 137) Identify an attribute from this chapter or from the scriptures. Follow the pattern found above to understand better and to plan for developing the attribute. Look at the image of the name tag. How does your name tag differ from that worn by an employee of a company? Note that the two most prominent parts are your name and the Savior’s name. How can you ensure that you represent the Savior as one of His disciples? Why is it important for people to associate your name with the Savior’s in a positive way? Write your thoughts in your study journal. #### Scripture Study (Page 137) - What are some attributes listed in the scriptures? - Mosiah 3:19, Alma 7:23, D&C 4, D&C 121:41–45, Articles of Faith 1:13, Philippians 4:8, 2 Peter 1:5–8 #### Remember This (Page 137) - You need to be a Christlike missionary, not just do missionary things. - Learning to be like Christ is a lifelong pursuit. - You follow Christ’s example—develop His attributes—one action and decision at a time. - Changing to become Christlike requires exercising faith, repenting, keeping covenants, receiving an increased measure of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. ##']","The principle found in 1 Nephi 3:7, which states that the Lord provides a way to accomplish His commandments, is directly related to the process of learning a mission language. Missionaries are encouraged to be dedicated and diligent in their language studies, understanding that while the task may seem challenging, divine assistance is available. This principle underscores the importance of diligence, as highlighted by President Ezra Taft Benson's emphasis on work in missionary efforts. By being diligent and obedient, missionaries can improve their language skills, which enhances their ability to communicate effectively and fulfill their purpose. The combination of divine guidance and personal effort ensures that missionaries can overcome language barriers and serve effectively."
How does 1 Nephi 8:12 relate to the missionary approach of sharing the Book of Mormon as the keystone of religion?,"['<1-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion (Page 117) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (History of the Church, 2:52). An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge- shaped pieces that lean against each other. The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways: - Witness of Christ. “The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.” - Fulness of doctrine. “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (D&C 20:9 [;27:5].) . . . In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation. And they are taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.” - Foundation of testimony. “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” (A Witness and a Warning [1988], 18–19). The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach investigators. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach investigators. | Missionary Lesson | Doctrines | References | | --- | --- | --- | | The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ | Apostasy, Restoration, Joseph Smith, priesthood authority | 1 Nephi 12-14 2 Nephi 3; 26-29 Mosiah 18 | | The Plan of Salvation | The “great plan of the eternal God,” including the Fall of Adam, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the Judgment | 2 Nephi 2; 9 Mosiah 3; 15 Alma 12; 40-42 | | The Gospel of Jesus Christ | Faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end | 2 Nephi 31-32 3 Nephi 11; 27 | | The Commandments; Laws and Ordinances | Ordinances such as baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament | 3 Nephi 11:22-28; 18 Moroni 2-6 |', '<2-hop>\n\nIn many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to . . .""* If a little more time is available, you might say more: *""Our message is simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ##']","1 Nephi 8:12 is referenced in the context of missionary work to illustrate the principle that as individuals experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it increases. This aligns with the missionary approach of using the Book of Mormon as the keystone of religion, as it is considered the most powerful resource in conversion. The Book of Mormon is used to teach the restored gospel, and as people learn and accept its teachings, they are encouraged to share these truths with others, thereby expanding the reach of the gospel message."
"How does the restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith relate to the commandments given to Moses, and what commitments are encouraged for personal spiritual growth?","['<1-hop>\n\nKeep the Ten Commandments (Page 90) Heavenly Father gives us commandments so that we will know what to do and what to avoid in order to receive the blessings He wants to give us (joy, peace of conscience, lasting happiness). God revealed to Moses the Ten Commandments to guide His people: - “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3). Other “gods” can include possessions, power, or prominence. - “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” (Exodus 20:4). - “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” (Exodus 20:7). - “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8). - “Honour thy father and thy mother” (Exodus 20:12). - “Thou shalt not kill” (Exodus 20:13). - “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:14). - “Thou shalt not steal” (Exodus 20:15). - “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” (Exodus 20:16). - “Thou shalt not covet” (Exodus 20:17). The Ten Commandments are still valid today. They teach us to worship and show reverence for God. They also teach us how to treat one another. #### No Other Gods (Page 90) People in many cultures own or pay respect to objects that remind them of Deity or ancestors. Sometimes those objects, such as statues, religious emblems, or small shrines, might also be the focus of their worship. Help them understand that the Lord has commanded us not to worship idols. Encourage them to remove from their home any object they worship or to which they pray. Help them focus their faith and worship on their Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Teach them that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ focuses on the living Christ. In the restored gospel the Lord has taught us how to remember Him. We remember Him through prayer, the sacrament, and temple worship. Your mission president will provide guidance in specific areas. #### Scripture Study (Page 91) - Mosiah 13, D&C 59:5–6, Matthew 22:36–40, Exodus 20:1–17, Deuteronomy 5:6–21 **Commitment** - Will you keep the Ten Commandments? ## Live the Law of Chastity (Page 91) God delights in chastity and hates sexual sin. Chastity includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one’s spouse after marriage. Those who live the law of chastity enjoy the strength that comes from self-control. They enjoy confidence and trust in their family relationships. They can enjoy more fully the influence of the Holy Ghost in their lives. Those who break this law are subject to a lasting sense of shame and guilt that burdens their lives. Chastity requires faithfulness in thought and action. We must keep our thoughts clean and be modest in our dress, speech, and actions. We must avoid pornography in any form. We should treat the God-given procreative power and our bodies as sacred. Baptismal candidates are to live the law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman. They are not to participate in abortions or homosexual or lesbian relations. Those who have committed sexual sin can repent and be forgiven.', '<2-hop>\n\nIdeas for Teaching (Page 55) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 55) After centuries of being lost, the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.']","The restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith is seen as a continuation of God's pattern of revealing His gospel to prophets, such as Moses, who received the Ten Commandments. These commandments guide individuals in worship and interpersonal conduct, emphasizing reverence for God and ethical behavior. The restoration through Joseph Smith, evidenced by the Book of Mormon, invites individuals to add to the truths they already hold dear. Commitments encouraged for personal spiritual growth include reading and praying to know the Book of Mormon is the word of God, praying to confirm Joseph Smith's prophetic role, and attending church, which aligns with the principles of the restored gospel and the commandments given to Moses."
"What does D&C 68:27 say about the age of accountability for baptism, and how does D&C 60:7–8 guide missionaries in sharing the gospel?","['<1-hop>\n\nBaptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nActivity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 172) - How had the man been prepared for the restored gospel? - What would have happened if the elders had never opened their mouths to share a gospel message? - Review what you did yesterday.

This guideline ensures that individuals are capable of making a conscious decision to enter into a covenant with God through baptism. On the other hand, D&C 60:7–8 provides guidance for missionaries, emphasizing the importance of opening their mouths to share the gospel message. It encourages them to teach and promises that as they do so, they will be blessed with the Spirit to guide their efforts in spreading the restored truths of the gospel."
How do the teachings in 3 Nephi 18:1–25 and 3 Nephi 12:48 relate to the principles of keeping the Sabbath day holy and developing Christlike attributes?,"['<1-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (Page 130) - What do these scriptures say about following Jesus Christ’s example? - 3 Nephi 12:48, John 13:1–16, 1 Peter 2:21, 3 Nephi 27:21, 27 - What is the relationship between the first principles of the gospel and Christlike attributes? - Moroni 8:25–26 ## Ideas for Studying This Chapter (Page 130) There are many approaches for studying this chapter. Try one of the following ideas: - As you complete the “Attribute Activity” at the end of this chapter, identify the attribute you most need or want to develop. Study the section about that attribute, and set goals for developing it. - Read through the chapter without studying the scriptures, and determine which attribute you want to study more fully. Then study the key scriptures associated with the attribute. Search for additional scriptures not listed in the chapter that teach about the attribute. Record in your study journal ideas for developing the attribute. - Identify an attribute you wish to study. Follow the pattern under the heading “Developing Christlike Attributes” found at the end of the chapter. ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 130) When you have faith in Christ, you believe in Him as the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the Flesh. You accept Him as your Savior and Redeemer and follow His teachings. You believe that your sins can be forgiven through His Atonement. Faith in Him means that you trust Him and are confident that He loves you. Faith leads to action, including repentance, obedience and dedicated service. When you have faith in Jesus Christ, you trust the Lord enough to follow His commandments—even when you do not completely understand the reasons for them. You accomplish what the Lord wants you to accomplish. You help bring about good in your own life and the lives of others. You are able to do miracles according to the Lord’s will. Your faith will be manifest through diligence and work. Faith is a principle of power. God works by power, but His power is usually exercised in response to faith (see Moroni 10:7). He works according to the faith of His children. Doubt and fear are opposed to faith. Your faith will increase through diligent study, prayer, dedicated service, and obedience to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the commandments. Your faith in Jesus Christ grows as you become better acquainted with Him and His teachings. As you explore the scriptures and search them, you learn of His ways, His love for all people, and His commandments. Faith includes confidence in the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. Through faith you receive answers to your prayers and personal inspiration to guide you in the Lord’s work. #### Scripture Study (Page 131) - What is faith? - Alma 32:21, Ether 12:6, Hebrews 11:1; see footnote b Topical Guide, “Faith”.

By keeping the Sabbath day holy, we show God our willingness to keep our covenants. Each Sabbath day we go to the Lord’s house to worship Him. While there we partake of the sacrament to remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement. We renew our covenants and show that we are willing to repent of our sins and mistakes. On this day, we enjoy a rest from our labors. As we attend Church services and worship together, we strengthen each other. We are renewed by our association with friends and family. Our faith is strengthened as we study the scriptures and learn more about the restored gospel. When a community or nation grows careless in its Sabbath activities, its religious life decays and all aspects of life are negatively affected. The blessings associated with keeping the Sabbath day holy are lost. We should refrain from shopping on the Sabbath and participating in other commercial and sporting activities that now commonly desecrate the Sabbath. Latter-day Saints should set this holy day apart from activities of the world by entering into a spirit of worship, thanksgiving, service, and family-centered activities appropriate to the Sabbath. As Church members endeavor to make their Sabbath activities compatible with the intent and Spirit of the Lord, their lives will be filled with joy and peace. #### Scripture Study (Page 88) - 3 Nephi 18:1–25, D&C 59:9–15, Exodus 20:8–11, Exodus 31:12–17, Isaiah 58:13–14 #### Sit with Investigators or Members at Church (Page 88) When attending sacrament meetings or stake conferences, missionary companionships should sit with investigators, recent converts, or members. They should not sit with other missionaries. - Will you keep the Sabbath day holy? - Will you prepare yourself to partake of the sacrament worthily? **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - What do you understand of the Sabbath day, including partaking of the sacrament weekly and rendering service to others? Are you willing to obey this law [before your baptism]? ## Baptism and Confirmation (Page 89) The way we show our desire to follow in God’s way is through baptism and confirmation. When we are baptized and confirmed, we enter into a covenant that we will take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and that we will always remember Him and keep His commandments. We also promise to stand as witnesses of God at all times and to assist those in need (see Mosiah 18:8–9). In return, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. #### Commitments (Page 89) - Will you be baptized and confirmed? - Will you invite your friends and family to attend a baptismal service? If possible, invite investigators to attend a baptismal service and a sacrament meeting during which someone is confirmed. **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - All baptismal interview questions. - Invitation to Be Baptize: The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ##']","The teachings in 3 Nephi 18:1–25 emphasize the importance of partaking in the sacrament as a way to remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement, which is a key aspect of keeping the Sabbath day holy. This practice reflects a commitment to honor and worship God, renew covenants, and repent of sins, aligning with the principles of Sabbath observance as described in the context. Meanwhile, 3 Nephi 12:48, which calls for followers to be perfect even as Christ is, relates to the development of Christlike attributes. This scripture encourages individuals to strive for spiritual growth and emulate the Savior's example, which is supported by the study of scriptures and the cultivation of faith as outlined in the context. Together, these teachings underscore the interconnectedness of Sabbath observance and the pursuit of Christlike attributes, both of which are essential for personal spiritual development and effective missionary work."
How do D&C 1:23 and D&C 28:16 relate to the message of the Restoration and the role of sharing the gospel?,"['<1-hop>\n\nThe Message of the Restoration: The Foundation of Faith (Page 20) No matter where you serve or whom you teach, center your teaching on the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ of the gospel of Jesus Christ. “The Lord will bless you as you teach the message of the Restoration to a world that desperately needs the gospel of Jesus Christ” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you study the doctrines in the missionary lessons, you will come to see that we have one message: Through a modern prophet, God has restored knowledge about the plan of salvation, which is centered on Christ’s Atonement and fulfilled by living the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Make sure that everyone you teach clearly understands the following: - God is our literal Father in Heaven. He loves us. Every person on earth is a child of God and a member of God’s family. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior and Redeemer. - Our loving Father in Heaven reached out to His children throughout biblical history by revealing His gospel to prophets. Sadly, many people rejected that gospel; even some of those who accepted it changed gospel doctrines and ordinances and fell into unbelief and apostasy. - Our Father in Heaven sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. He performed miracles and taught His gospel. He accomplished the Atonement and was resurrected. - Beginning with the First Vision, God has again reached out in love to His children. He restored the gospel of Jesus Christ and His priesthood authority and organized His Church on the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence of this Restoration. As you help investigators see the pattern of apostasy and restoration, they will be prepared to understand the great need for the latter-day Restoration. They will see the need to accept the restored gospel, receive the ordinances of salvation by the authority of the restored priesthood, and follow the way to eternal life. Help people recognize that the Church is not just another religion, nor is it an American church. Rather, it is a restoration of the “fulness of [the] gospel” (D&C 1:23), the same as was revealed and taught from the beginning. The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. It is the keystone of our religion, the most powerful resource for teaching this message. Some important truths restored through Joseph Smith include the knowledge that God is our Father and that we are His spirit children, that we lived with Him before birth, and that families can live together forever in God’s presence through Christ’s Atonement by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel. The Book of Mormon is evidence of the love of God for His children. It shows that God speaks to His children. As you teach and testify, invite people to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its message. Each person you teach must decide whether to accept the Book of Mormon as revelation from God. Trust the remarkable promise in Moroni 10:3–5. Do all you can to persuade people to read the book, understand it, and ask God sincerely whether it is true. The witness of the Holy Ghost becomes the cornerstone of their faith that Christ has restored His Church. Help those you teach to receive that spiritual confirmation. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nActivity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 172) - How had the man been prepared for the restored gospel? - What would have happened if the elders had never opened their mouths to share a gospel message? - Review what you did yesterday.

When you meet people, be prepared to teach brief summaries of restored truth so that the Holy Ghost can bear witness that you are the servants of the Lord. In many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet.']","D&C 1:23 relates to the message of the Restoration by emphasizing that the Church is not just another religion but a restoration of the 'fulness of [the] gospel,' as revealed and taught from the beginning. This underscores the importance of the Restoration in bringing back the original truths of God through a modern prophet. D&C 28:16, on the other hand, highlights the importance of opening one's mouth to share the gospel message. It promises that by doing so, individuals are fulfilling their role as servants of the Lord, which is crucial in spreading the message of the Restoration. Together, these scriptures emphasize the need to teach and testify of the restored gospel, ensuring that people understand its significance and the divine authority behind it."

Teaching is central to everything you do. You develop Christlike attributes, study the missionary lessons, improve your ability to speak in your mission language, and rely on the Spirit in order to teach with convincing power. The Lord stated this very simply as a commandment with a promise: “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the [missionary lessons] but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). Learn to rely on the Spirit to give you what you should say and do. By studying, developing, and using the teaching skills in this chapter, you will become a more capable instrument in the hands of the Lord. The Spirit will draw upon the knowledge and skills you have developed to help you teach more powerfully. The quality and power of your teaching will help others understand and feel the importance the restored gospel has for them. Their understanding will be influenced by your personal worthiness. Their understanding will also be influenced by how well you focus your attention on them, by how well you explain the gospel, use the scriptures, share your testimony, ask questions, and invite them to make and keep commitments. #### Follow the Spirit (Page 190) “The Spirit is the most important single element in this work. With the Spirit magnifying your call, you can do miracles for the Lord in the mission field. Without the Spirit, you will never succeed regardless of your talent and ability” (Ezra Taft Benson, seminar for new mission presidents, 25 June 1986). #### Invite the Spirit (Page 190) The following suggestions will help you invite the Spirit as you teach: - Pray. - Use the scriptures. - Bear testimony. - Share experiences. - Express love for the Lord and for others. ##']","D&C 68:25 emphasizes the role of families as the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles, highlighting the importance of families in spiritual education and development. D&C 84:85 guides missionaries by instructing them not to worry about what they will say beforehand but to treasure up the words of life, promising that the Spirit will provide them with the necessary words at the right moment. This guidance helps missionaries teach the restored gospel effectively by relying on divine inspiration and personal conviction."
How do the principles of prayer and scripture study in 2 Nephi 32:8-9 and 2 Nephi 33:1 guide Latter-day Saints in making and keeping commitments to gospel principles?,"['<1-hop>\n\nPray Often (Page 87) God commands us to pray to Him. You can pray at any time and in any setting. The Lord has taught us to kneel and pray in the morning and in the evening, as individuals and with our families. Our Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. Through daily prayer we receive divine guidance and blessings. We should always pray sincerely. We should also pray with “real intent,” which means we are committed to act on the answer that we receive. We pray with faith to our Father in Heaven in the name of Jesus Christ (see Moses 5:8). Because He is our Father and we are His children, He will answer our prayers. We begin our prayers by addressing our Father in Heaven. We end our prayers by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.” In prayer we speak openly and honestly with our loving Father in Heaven. We express gratitude and thanksgiving for our blessings. We may acknowledge our love for Him. We also ask for help, protection, and direction according to our needs. As we pray with faith, sincerity, and real intent, we will see God’s influence in our lives. He will guide us in our daily lives and help us make good decisions. He will bless us with feelings of comfort and peace. He will warn us of danger and strengthen us to resist temptation. He will forgive our sins. We will feel closer to Him. We must learn to recognize His influence in our lives. We must learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Spirit. We can recognize when the Holy Ghost is teaching us the truth. Our minds will be filled with inspiring and uplifting thoughts. We will be enlightened, or given new knowledge. Our hearts will have feelings of peace, joy, and love. We will want to do good and be helpful to others. These feelings are hard to describe but can be recognized as we experience them. #### Scripture Study (Page 87) | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 2 Nephi 32:8-9 | D&C 6:22-23 | D&C 19:28 | | Enos 1:1-12 | D&C 8:2-3 | 1 Kings 19:11-12 | | Alma 34:17-28 | D&C 9:7-9 | Bible Dictionary, “Prayer” | | Moroni 10:3-5 | | | **Commitment** - Will you kneel and pray daily as individuals and as a family? ## Study the Scriptures (Page 87) The scriptures are written records of God’s dealings with His children as recorded by prophets under the influence of the Holy Ghost. We show our faith by studying, believing, and obeying God’s revealed word. We diligently search the scriptures to understand the truth. We feast upon them because they open the door to revelation and show us what we need to do and become. We search the scriptures to learn about Jesus Christ and His gospel. Faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from God and comes through studying and living His word and His gospel. The approved scriptures of the Church, also called the standard works, are the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.

Without the completed action, the commitment is hollow. Change can be hard. Your role is to help strengthen people in their resolve to change. You should do all you can to help people keep their commitments. Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time especially for commandments such as chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and tithing. As you and ward leaders work with people to help them keep their commitments, show understanding. Be patient but persistent. You have not finished your ministry until people are living these commitments, or in other words, until they have repented (see 3 Nephi 18:32). Sometimes several visits may be necessary for you to help people develop strong enough faith in a principle to lead to repentance. Following up begins when you first visit and teach people: - Have them write their commitment on something you leave with them, such as a pamphlet or a card with your names and phone number. - Make sure people know that you will make brief, daily visits between teaching appointments. Explain that your purpose is to support and help them. Give them an idea of what you will do during those visits. - Make specific notes in the Notes/To Do List section of your planner to follow up tomorrow on every commitment invitation you have extended today. Make frequent contact, daily if possible, to find out how people are progressing with their commitments, answer questions, help them overcome challenges, teach additional lessons, read together from the Book of Mormon, share passages of scripture, or use audiovisual materials. As you visit people often, you will strengthen the spiritual feelings they felt as you taught them the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital. There may be times when you call the investigators to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment. Help investigators identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message. Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments. Investigators are changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are with them. Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 215) - Write in your daily planner your plans for daily contact with each investigator. Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with investigators. - Choose one commitment invitation you will extend when you teach the lessons. Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment. Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns. #### Remember This (Page 215) - Focus on inviting people to make commitments in every finding or teaching situation, both with those who are not members of the Church and with Church members. - Extend commitment invitations to help people experience conversion. - Promise blessings. - Bear testimony. - Follow through to help people keep commitments. ##']","The principles of prayer and scripture study as outlined in 2 Nephi 32:8-9 and 2 Nephi 33:1 provide a foundation for Latter-day Saints to make and keep commitments to gospel principles. In 2 Nephi 32:8-9, the importance of praying with real intent and faith is emphasized, which helps individuals receive divine guidance and blessings. This aligns with the practice of kneeling and praying daily, both individually and as a family, to seek God's influence in their lives. Similarly, 2 Nephi 33:1 highlights the power of the Spirit in bearing testimony, which strengthens one's resolve to live according to gospel teachings. By studying the scriptures diligently, individuals open the door to revelation and gain the knowledge needed to follow Jesus Christ and His gospel. These practices of prayer and scripture study are crucial in helping individuals make commitments, as they provide spiritual strength and guidance, enabling them to experience conversion and keep their commitments to gospel principles."

(Page 231) The full-time mission president holds the keys for convert baptisms. Under his direction, full-time missionaries have primary responsibility for teaching investigators. However, the bishop oversees the progress and friendshipping of investigators as they are being taught. The ward mission plan is carried out under the presiding authority of the bishop. The mission president meets regularly with stake presidents to make sure that full-time missionaries cooperate with local priesthood leaders. He coordinates proselyting efforts and offers to help the stake president provide instruction in the principles and practices of missionary work. ## What Are the Responsibilities of Stake and Ward Leaders? (Page 231) Local Church leaders and members are your best allies. Respect them and strive to build good relationships with them. As you work with these leaders, remember that they have other responsibilities associated with their callings. Seek to be a blessing, not a burden, to the leaders of your stake and ward. Your attitude should be one of, “How can we help?” Counsel with the bishop and ward mission leader concerning your plans and activities. Make sure that what you do supports the ward mission plan. The roles of local priesthood leadership in missionary work are described below. Understanding their roles will help you better work with them. ### Stake President (Page 231) The stake president oversees bishops in their missionary, retention, and activation responsibilities. In his monthly interview with bishops, he discusses plans and the progress of specific investigators and members. He ensures that the doctrines relating to missionary work are taught regularly in stake and ward meetings and that priesthood leaders and others are trained in their missionary responsibilities. The stake president also meets regularly with the mission president to coordinate missionary efforts, including the training of leaders and members, use and placement of full-time missionaries, and assistance in activation efforts. ### High Councilor (Page 232) A high councilor is assigned by the stake presidency to promote missionary, retention, and activation work in the stake. He regularly reports the progress of this work to the stake presidency. He also ensures that ward mission leaders are properly trained in their duties, including the preparation of a ward mission plan.']","The bishop collaborates with missionaries and the ward council by identifying and contacting people who may be receptive to the message of the Restoration, such as those who have recently had a baby, moved to the area, or experienced a death in the family.

It is manifest in confidence, optimism, enthusiasm, and patient perseverance. It is believing and expecting that something will occur. When you have hope, you work through trials and difficulties with the confidence and assurance that all things will work together for your good. Hope helps you conquer discouragement. The scriptures often describe hope in Jesus Christ as the assurance that you will inherit eternal life in the celestial kingdom. President James E. Faust taught: “Hope is the anchor of our souls. . . . “Hope is trust in God’s promises, faith that if we act now, the desired blessings will be fulfilled in the future. . . . “The unfailing source of our hope is that we are sons and daughters of God and that His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, saved us from death” (“Hope, an Anchor of the Soul,” Ensign, Nov. 1999, 59–60). “Being blessed with hope, let us, as disciples, reach out to all who, for whatever reason, have ‘moved away from the hope of the gospel’ (Col. 1:23).

MAXWELL “BRIGHTNESS OF HOPE,” ENSIGN, NOV. 1994, 36 #### Scripture Study (Page 131) - What is hope and what do we hope for? | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 2 Nephi 31:20 | Moroni 7:40-48 | Romans 8:24-25 | | Alma 58:10-11 | D&C 59:23 | Hebrews 6:10-20 | | Ether 12:4, 32 | D&C 138:14 | Topical Guide, “Hope” | ## Charity and Love (Page 132) A man once asked Jesus, “Which is the great commandment in the law?” Jesus replied: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (Matthew 22:36–39). Charity is “the pure love of Christ” (Moroni 7:47). It includes God’s eternal love for all His children. We are to seek to develop that kind of love. When you are filled with charity, you obey God’s commandments and do all you can to serve others and help them receive the restored gospel. Charity is a gift from God. The prophet Mormon said that we should “pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filled with this love” (Moroni 7:48). As you follow this counsel and strive to do righteous works, your love for all people will increase, especially those among whom you labor. You will come to feel a sincere concern for the eternal welfare and happiness of other people. You will see them as children of God with the potential of becoming like our Heavenly Father, and you will labor in their behalf. You will avoid negative feelings such as anger, envy, lust, or covetousness. You will avoid judging others, criticizing them, or saying negative things about them. You will try to understand them and their points of view. You will be patient with them and try to help them when they are struggling or discouraged. Charity, like faith, leads to action. You will develop charity as you look for opportunities to serve others and give of yourself. #### Scripture Study (Page 132) - What is charity? - Moroni 7:45–48, 1 Corinthians 13, Bible Dictionary, “Charity” - How did Jesus Christ demonstrate charity? - 1 Nephi 19:9, Alma 7:11–13, Ether 12:33–34, Luke 7:12–15 - What do these verses teach you about charity? - 2 Nephi 26:30, Mosiah 2:17, Mosiah 28:3, Alma 7:24, Ether 12:28, D&C 88:125, 1 Timothy 4:12, 1 Peter 4:8; see footnote a', '<2-hop>\n\nDefining Words (Page 35) We have a powerful message with a unique vocabulary. Just as a physician speaks differently in the family waiting room than in the operating room, so too must you learn to speak so that those who are unfamiliar with our message can understand what you are teaching. To prepare to help others understand unfamiliar words, study the list of key definitions and terms in the ”Ideas for Teaching“ section of each lesson. Become familiar with the definitions provided. Use True to the Faith and the Bible Dictionary to find definitions for other words. Write these definitions in your study journal. Share the definitions with your companion and others to see if you understand. If the definitions are unclear to others, revise your definitions based on the material you have studied. As you teach, seek to discern whether a word or principle is new to the person you are teaching. Take time to explain unfamiliar words or principles. Remember to teach for understanding so that you and those you teach “are edified and rejoice together” (D&C 50:22). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 35) Turn to the lesson “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ” located in chapter 3. Read the list of key definitions in the “Ideas for Teaching” section. Locate three other words in the lesson that you would like to define. Follow the suggestions given above in creating a definition for each. ## Study Ideas and Suggestions (Page 36) Each of the ideas and suggestions in this section can make your study time more rewarding and spiritually uplifting. Consider the following as you plan your study: - Always begin with a prayer. - Plan study activities that will build your faith in the Savior and use your time productively. - Plan your study around people, their needs, and preparing them for baptism, confirmation, and enduring to the end. Note your study plans in your daily planner. - Plan your study by asking: What will I be teaching today? How can I plan my study to best help those I teach? Which ideas and suggestions from this section will I incorporate in my study? As you plan your study activities, experiment with some of the ideas and suggestions that follow or with additional ideas you learn from others. ### Apply and Live What You Learn (Page 36) - “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23). - Set goals to live what you are learning. - Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it. - Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals.']","The principles of hope and charity, as described in the scriptures, are deeply connected to the concept of edification and rejoicing together as mentioned in D&C 50:22. Hope is described as an abiding trust in the Lord's promises, manifesting in confidence and perseverance, which helps individuals work through trials with assurance of future blessings. Charity, on the other hand, is the pure love of Christ, leading to actions that serve others and promote their eternal welfare. Both hope and charity foster an environment where individuals are uplifted and supported, aligning with the idea in D&C 50:22 that teaching and learning should result in mutual edification and joy. By embodying hope and charity, individuals can create a community where understanding and spiritual growth are shared, fulfilling the scriptural mandate to be edified and rejoice together."
How do Moroni 6:1–4 and Moroni 6:8 guide missionaries in teaching repentance and baptism to investigators?,"['<1-hop>\n\nFor example, the Restoration of the goepel is called a restitution (see Acts 3:19–21). The word restoration also refers to the restoration of the body (see Alma 41:10–15). ### Other Terms That May Need Further Definition for Those You Teach (Page 84) - Clean from sin - Prayer - Temptation - Confession - Sacrament - Forgiveness - Strait and narrow path > Lesson Four # The Commandments: Preparing for Baptism and Confirmation (Page 85) There are many ways to teach the commandments found in this lesson. For example, you might teach a few of the commandments from this lesson as part of the first three lessons, or you might teach several commandments as a single lesson. What you do should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. ## Prepare to Teach (Page 85) Your purpose in teaching the commandments is to help people live the gospel by exercising faith in Jesus Christ and repenting as they prepare for baptism and confirmation. By obeying the commandments, people will grow in their testimony of the gospel, show that they have “broken hearts and contrite spirits,” and begin to repent of all their sins (see Moroni 6:1–4; D&C 20:37). This lesson is organized differently from the first three. The first three lessons explain the doctrinal foundation for the gospel of Jesus Christ. This lesson explains specific commandments God has given that help us apply gospel principles in our lives. There are many ways to teach this lesson. The approach you take should be determined by the needs of the investigators and direction from the Spirit. Constantly think and pray about how to help investigators live the gospel. Ideas include: - Teaching one or more commandments as part of the first three lessons. When doing so, consider the principle taught in Alma 12:32: “God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption” (italics added). Certain commandments, such as prayer and scripture study, might be taught best as part of the first three lessons. Other commandments might be best taught after you have laid the doctrinal foundation of the gospel found in the first three lessons. - Teaching two or three of the commandments as a single lesson. - Teaching a single commandment as a lesson. - Teaching the commandments in the context of the gospel. Briefly review the lesson on the gospel of Jesus Christ before teaching one or more of the commandments. As you do so, you can help investigators see how the commandments fit into the larger picture of exercising faith in the Savior and repenting in preparation for baptism and confirmation. Their lives can be blessed as they see the gospel of Jesus Christ as a pattern for living. You may be able to teach some investigators in a few visits; others may require more visits. You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material. There are many ways you may approach teaching this lesson. Which commandment you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it is best determined by the needs of the investigators and the direction of the Spirit. ##', '<2-hop>\n\n#### Develop a Good Relationship with Investigators (Page 200) To avoid embarrassment, some people will answer questions the way they think you want them to answer rather than share true feelings. Seek to develop a relationship that allows them to be comfortable sharing their true feelings with you. ## Help People Resolve Their Concerns (Page 201) Some of those you teach will lack the faith to keep commitments, others will face opposition, and others will not always accept everything you share. They must make their own choices, but you will want to do all you can to answer their questions, help them resolve their concerns, and overcome opposition. Sometimes people’s concerns are like an iceberg. Only a small portion is visible above the surface. These concerns can be complex and difficult to resolve. For this reason you need to follow the Spirit and respond in a manner best suited to the situation. Pray for the gift of discernment and follow your impressions. Heavenly Father knows the hearts and experiences of all people (the complete iceberg) and will help you know what is best for each person. When you help others resolve their concerns, first seek to understand their concerns by asking questions and listening. Rely on the Spirit to help you know how to help them resolve their concerns. For example, you might use a scripture to address a concern about the need for baptism, or you might share your testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Often concerns are more social than doctrinal. For example, investigators might fear opposition from family members if they join the Church. Or they might fear rejection from their friends at work. Whatever the concern may be, your investigators may have past experiences or other influences that are part of the concern that you do not understand. In many cases, members may be able to help you understand and help with their concerns. How you approach an investigator’s concern will depend on the nature of that concern. Determine whether the concern has come up because the person does not have a spiritual confirmation of the truth of the Restoration or whether the person does not want to commit to living a true principle. Understanding the source of the problem in this way helps you know whether to focus on testimony or commitment. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 201) Choose one commitment invitation you extend when you teach the lessons. Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment. Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns. ## Repentance and Addiction Recovery (Page 201) Repentance is a spiritual process that involves humility, confession, restitution, and turning away from the sin. It is a permanent change of thoughts and actions. Ideally, repenting of a specific sin should be necessary only once. However, if the sin is repeated, repentance is available as a means of healing (see Mosiah 26:30; Moroni 6:8; D&C 1:31–32). Repentance may involve an emotional and physical process. People must stop ongoing, ingrained ways of inappropriate acting. Undesirable actions must be replaced with healthy and appropriate behaviors. Thus, both repentance and recovery may take time. Sometimes converts, even with the best of intentions, give in to temptation as they progress toward greater self-discipline. In such cases new converts work with their priesthood leaders, not with the missionaries, as they seek to overcome temptation and to fully repent. Through baptism and confirmation people receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which will strengthen their ability to overcome these challenges. But baptism and confirmation may not fully do away with the emotional and physical urges that go along with these behaviors. Even though a person may have some initial success, further emotional healing may be necessary to completely repent and recover. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 202) - Think of an investigator, recent convert, or less-active member who is trying to overcome addiction. - Review “Faith in Jesus Christ” and “Repentance” from the “The Gospel of Jesus Christ” lesson in chapter 3. - What could you teach this person from this lesson and from this chapter that will help him or her overcome addiction? - Create a lesson plan to help this individual. ##']","Moroni 6:1–4 emphasizes the importance of preparing for baptism and confirmation by exercising faith in Jesus Christ and repenting, which involves having 'broken hearts and contrite spirits.' This preparation helps individuals grow in their testimony of the gospel and begin to repent of all their sins. Moroni 6:8 highlights that repentance is an ongoing process, available even if sins are repeated, as a means of healing. Together, these scriptures guide missionaries to teach repentance as a spiritual process that involves humility, confession, and turning away from sin, while also preparing individuals for baptism and confirmation, where they receive the gift of the Holy Ghost to strengthen their ability to overcome challenges."
How can missionaries effectively use study journals and referrals to enhance their teaching and engagement with the gospel as outlined on Page 41 and Page 177?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 41) 1. Invite missionaries to bring their study journals to interviews. Invite them to share one entry with you. 2. During interviews, ask some of the following questions: – What impressions have you had recently in your scripture study? – What is one gospel principle that your companion has recently taught you? – What chapter or section of this manual has helped you most in the past two weeks? – What are you doing in your personal study that helps you learn the most? 3. During zone conferences, invite missionaries to share meaningful experiences they have had in their personal and companion study. 4. During zone conferences, allow missionaries to share personal study ideas. 5. Share with missionaries insights you have had in your personal study. Share entries from your study journal and your testimony of the importance of gospel study. 6. As you can, join missionaries in their companion study. 7. During interviews, invite missionaries to share one of their lesson plans from one of the missionary lessons. Ask them what these doctrines mean to them. > Beginning of chapter 3 of the 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual #', '<2-hop>\n\nIdeas for Helping Members (Page 176) There are many ways to encourage members to become more involved in missionary work. Consider the following ideas: - Seek the guidance of the bishop and other ward leaders. See chapter 13 for additional help in this area. - Teach Church leaders and members the message of the Restoration and other lessons. - Teach them to love and serve their neighbors and friends. - Encourage them to fast and pray for missionary opportunities. - Encourage them to visit acquaintances who have recently experienced a life-changing event (birth, death in the family, marriage, or recently moved). - Invite them to help you teach. The ideal situation is to have a Church member with you who formerly belonged to the same church as the investigator. - Help them set dates when they will invite their friends to learn about the message of the Restoration. - Show them items they can give others, such as copies of the Book of Mormon, videos, and pass-along cards. - Encourage them to invite their friends to attend church or family home evening, to view a Church-produced video, or to participate in a gospel conversation. - Help them practice what they could say to their friends. - Teach them why it is valuable to share the gospel regardless of the result. There are many other ways to help members get more involved. Seek to add to this list throughout your mission. Share your ideas with other missionaries. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 176) With your companion, review what you have done to serve and help the bishop and other leaders and members during the past month. Discuss and plan what you can do during the upcoming month to develop a stronger relationship with them. Review the ideas listed in the “Ideas for Helping Members” box. Identify some ideas you have not yet tried. Using your daily planner, make plans and try some of the ideas during the next week. ## Media and Church Headquarters Referrals (Page 177) Referrals are another resource in finding those being prepared for the restored gospel. In addition to member referrals, the Church actively reaches out in many ways to God’s children. The Church creates interest through efforts such as media advertising, visitors’ centers, historic sites, welfare and humanitarian aid, and the Internet (www.mormon.org, www.lds.org, www.familysearch.org). Referrals received from media and Church headquarters represent people who have agreed to have Church representatives visit to deliver an item (such as the Holy Bible or Book of Mormon) and be taught more about the Church. These teaching opportunities should be viewed by missionaries as a sacred responsibility. Before you visit a referral, make sure you are familiar with the item that has been requested. Plan a short lesson to transition from the item to teaching the message of the Restoration. In some cases referrals lead you to others whom God is preparing. If the people you contact are not interested, ask them if they know someone who might have interest. Also, talk with other members of the household and their neighbors. Ask each one who else might be interested in your message. Perhaps you have been led to this person because someone else in the home or neighborhood is ready for the gospel. When working with referrals, remember to: - Contact them within 24 hours. - If feasible, call ahead of time to arrange an appointment to visit. If they are not home, try different times of the day. - Deliver the requested item, and remind them that they requested your visit. Gather all in the household to listen. - Teach the message of the Restoration. - Extend invitations that will build their faith in Christ. - Ask for referrals. - Arrange for a return visit. - Plan to work in that neighborhood after your appointment ends. - If the person is not home, talk to the neighbors. ####']","Missionaries can effectively use study journals by bringing them to interviews and sharing entries with their mission president, as suggested on Page 41. This practice allows them to reflect on their scripture study, share gospel principles learned from companions, and discuss personal study methods that are most beneficial. Additionally, missionaries are encouraged to share meaningful experiences and study ideas during zone conferences. On Page 177, referrals are highlighted as a valuable resource for finding individuals prepared for the gospel. Missionaries should contact referrals within 24 hours, deliver requested items, and teach the message of the Restoration. They are advised to extend invitations to build faith in Christ and ask for further referrals, ensuring a continuous engagement with the community."

They are instructions from a loving Father in Heaven to help us have happy lives. He also gives us agency, or the ability and opportunity to choose between good and evil. When we obey God, we follow the influence of the Spirit and choose to conform to His will. Obedience to the commandments brings us peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. Obedience shows our love for God. Disobedience brings us sorrow. Heavenly Father knows our weaknesses and is patient with us. He blesses us as we strive to obey His commandments.

Never be alone with anyone younger than age 18. Be cautious about playing with groups of children, such as joining a soccer or other game. Do not do anything where your actions might be misinterpreted. Whenever possible, get a parent’s permission to interact with a child. Do not tickle children, change diapers, hold or hug children, or allow children to sit on your lap. These actions could appear inappropriate or be misinterpreted.

Appropriate places to visit may include (but are not limited to) the following: Historical and cultural sites Museums and galleries Zoos and parks > 3.6.1 ### General Recreation Standards Avoid gathering as large groups of missionaries in public places. Normally, this means you should not gather in groups larger than the size of your district. Doing so can draw unnecessary attention or make people feel intimidated. Use mission vehicles only for activities that are authorized by your mission president. Exercise and be active to keep your body fit for missionary work. Play sports in ways that avoid injury and extreme fatigue. > 3.6.2 ### Unauthorized Activities Always be safe and use common sense when participating in recreational activities. Because missionaries have been seriously injured while participating in risky activities, you should not participate in activities during your mission that involve increased risk.

This collaboration helps in finding people to teach through their own efforts. While doing so, missionaries must maintain honesty in all their dealings, including giving accurate reports of their work and respecting others by not borrowing or using personal items without permission. Additionally, they should build trust and meaningful relationships by being professional and kind, always staying with their companion, and referring members to their bishop if they need counseling. These practices ensure that missionaries maintain appropriate interactions while working with the bishop to find people to teach."

How can the teachings in Alma 32 and Alma 42:31 be applied to enhance personal growth and effective teaching in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 148) ### Personal Study (Page 148) - Review the suggestions in this chapter. Identify a suggestion you have not yet tried, and set a goal to try it for the next few days. - At your next district meeting, ask an experienced missionary with good language ability what he or she has done to learn the language. - Read and discuss the following statement by Elder Richard G. Scott: “Where . . . national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God, set them aside. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished” (“Removing Barriers to Happiness,” Ensign, May 1998, 87). Think about the ways that the culture in the area where you serve is different from your own. Make a list of the differences. Then cross out any that conflict with the teachings of the gospel. Consider each of those that remain, and think about how you can make these customs your own. - Build a study plan to prepare you to do one of the following things in your mission language: - Tell the Joseph Smith story. - Summarize 3 Nephi 11. - Summarize Alma 32. - Tell the story of Nephi and the brass plates (see 1 Nephi 3–5). - Explain dispensations. - Share a personal experience. - Make note cards for words you don’t know in one of the lessons. Carry them with you until you have learned them all.', '<2-hop>\n\nAs you teach people to understand the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel, you “declare repentance” (D&C 15:6). Repentance involves a change of heart and a desire to forsake sin and serve God. It involves humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to God’s will. It requires that people increase their commitment to live in agreement with God’s will. Repentance requires a sincere and lasting change of thoughts, desires, habits, and actions. It is a positive experience that brings joy and peace. Be bold and loving in helping people understand what they must do to repent. By inviting people to make commitments, you can effectively raise a voice of both warning and hope. #### Scripture Study (Page 22) What do these scriptures teach about declaring repentance? - Read Alma 29:1–4 Alma 42:31, Alma 62:45 D&C 14:8, and D&C 15:6; 16:6 for answersto the question. ## Baptism and Confirmation (Page 23) Baptizing and confirming the people you teach is central to your purpose. Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost brings a host of blessings to those who live worthy of it. Through these ordinances people enter the gate and continue on the path to eternal life. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said: “We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church. We do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives. . . . We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the sons and daughters of God. No one else can do this” (“The Purpose of Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1995). As you teach the restored gospel, help people understand the sacred nature of baptism and confirmation. Help them realize that receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is a great blessing in this life and a key to their salvation. The Holy Ghost will “teach [them] all things” (John 14:26). President Boyd K. Packer taught: “When you are teaching investigators and preparing them for baptism by water, you must also think of the gift of the Holy Ghost— baptism by fire. Think of it as one sentence. First comes the baptism of water and then the baptism of fire” (“The Gift of the Holy Ghost: What Every Missionary Should Know—and Every Member As Well,” seminar for new mission presidents, June 2003). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (History of the Church, 5:499). Help those you teach understand that to qualify for baptism and confirmation they must meet the conditions given in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. ### D&C 20:37 Qualifications for Baptism (page 23) - Humble themselves before God. - Desire to be baptized. - Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. - Repent of all their sins. - Are willing to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ. - Have a determination to serve Christ to the end. - Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins. After worthy converts are baptized, they are confirmed members of the Church and the gift of the Holy Ghost is conferred upon them. This confirmation occurs under the direction of the bishop or branch president in a sacrament meeting soon after the baptism. While the two ordinances are separated by a brief time, confirmation complements and completes baptism. ####']","The teachings in Alma 32, which focus on faith and the process of nurturing it like a seed, can be applied to personal growth in missionary work by encouraging missionaries to develop and strengthen their faith through consistent study and application of gospel principles. This aligns with the idea of setting goals and trying new study suggestions as mentioned in the personal study section. Alma 42:31 emphasizes declaring repentance, which is crucial for effective teaching. By understanding and teaching the principles of repentance, missionaries can help others experience a change of heart and a commitment to live in accordance with God's will, thus enhancing their teaching effectiveness and spiritual insights."
How do the teachings in Moroni 10:3–5 and Moroni 10:7 guide missionaries in developing faith and helping others make commitments in their missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 22) How should you use the Book of Mormon in your missionary work? - Read 1 Nephi 13:39 2 Nephi 29:8–10, Moroni 10:3–5 D&C 20:5–16, D&C 42:12–14 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 22) Imagine that you are going to write an article about the message of the Restoration for a local newspaper. In your study journal write a title that describes the central message. Then record your thoughts and feelings about this message, including how understanding it better has changed the way you live and the way you view the world around you. ## Helping Others Make Commitments: The Door to Faith and Repentance (Page 22) Help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “The first thing you will do when an investigator tells you he or she had not read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! . . . Much of the time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the balance. . . . It is the most important path this investigator will ever walk. But if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! . . . So take control of this situation.

Try one of the following ideas: - As you complete the “Attribute Activity” at the end of this chapter, identify the attribute you most need or want to develop. Study the section about that attribute, and set goals for developing it. - Read through the chapter without studying the scriptures, and determine which attribute you want to study more fully. Then study the key scriptures associated with the attribute. Search for additional scriptures not listed in the chapter that teach about the attribute. Record in your study journal ideas for developing the attribute. - Identify an attribute you wish to study. Follow the pattern under the heading “Developing Christlike Attributes” found at the end of the chapter. ## Faith in Jesus Christ (Page 130) When you have faith in Christ, you believe in Him as the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the Flesh. You accept Him as your Savior and Redeemer and follow His teachings. You believe that your sins can be forgiven through His Atonement. Faith in Him means that you trust Him and are confident that He loves you. Faith leads to action, including repentance, obedience and dedicated service. When you have faith in Jesus Christ, you trust the Lord enough to follow His commandments—even when you do not completely understand the reasons for them. You accomplish what the Lord wants you to accomplish. You help bring about good in your own life and the lives of others. You are able to do miracles according to the Lord’s will. Your faith will be manifest through diligence and work. Faith is a principle of power. God works by power, but His power is usually exercised in response to faith (see Moroni 10:7). He works according to the faith of His children. Doubt and fear are opposed to faith. Your faith will increase through diligent study, prayer, dedicated service, and obedience to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the commandments. Your faith in Jesus Christ grows as you become better acquainted with Him and His teachings. As you explore the scriptures and search them, you learn of His ways, His love for all people, and His commandments. Faith includes confidence in the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. Through faith you receive answers to your prayers and personal inspiration to guide you in the Lord’s work. #### Scripture Study (Page 131) - What is faith? - Alma 32:21, Ether 12:6, Hebrews 11:1; see footnote b Topical Guide, “Faith”.

This passage encourages individuals to ponder the mercies of God and seek divine confirmation through the Holy Ghost, which is a foundational step in building faith. Moroni 10:7 highlights that God works according to the faith of His children, suggesting that faith is a principle of power that enables individuals to accomplish the Lord's work. For missionaries, this means that their faith in Jesus Christ and His teachings can lead to personal inspiration and the ability to perform miracles according to the Lord's will. By developing their own faith and helping others to do the same, missionaries can effectively teach true doctrine, invite repentance, and encourage commitments that lead to baptism and confirmation, as outlined in the missionary guide. These commitments are essential for building faith in Jesus Christ and preparing individuals to make and keep sacred covenants."

Through goals and plans, our hopes are transformed into action. Goal setting and planning are acts of faith. Prayerfully set goals that are in harmony with the Savior’s command to “teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Matthew 28:19). Set goals for each key indicator. You may also set goals for your personal development. Do everything within your power to achieve your goals while respecting the agency of others. The ultimate measure of success is not in achieving goals alone but in the service you render and the progress of others. Goals are a means of helping you bring about much good among Heavenly Father’s children. They are not to be used to receive recognition. Carefully considered goals will give you clear direction and will help you fill your days with activities that help people strengthen their faith in the Savior and progress toward baptism, confirmation, and full activity in the Church. Challenging goals will help you work effectively and lead you to stretch and grow. Follow the guidelines below as you set goals: - Follow the Spirit. - Focus on the key indicators. - Focus on people. Although you will use numbers, be able to support your numbers with the names of people where possible. - Be specific and realistic, but set goals that will make you stretch.', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 128) - Teach the missionaries how to use the Book of Mormon to confirm the truthfulness of the message of the Restoration. - Read 1 Nephi 1 with the missionaries and compare it with Joseph Smith’s experience. - Provide missionaries with a clean paperback copy of the Book of Mormon. Have them highlight in different colors: - Each reference to Jesus Christ (any of His names or pronouns referring to Him). - His words (spoken by Him or by prophets when they say, “Thus saith the Lord”). - His attributes. - The doctrines and principles contained in the Book of Mormon. At the bottom of each page ask the missionaries to count the total number of items referenced. In interviews and during district meetings during the two- or three-month period for this activity, have missionaries share with each other what they’ve learned. You might consider doing a similar activity with the entire mission highlighting references to faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, or any of the fundamental principles of the gospel. - During interviews, invite missionaries to share with you Book of Mormon scriptures that have changed their lives. - Help missionaries see how the Book of Mormon teaches the doctrines from the missionary lessons. For example, if the topic were the Atonement, have missionaries write in one column each major element of the Atonement taught in the Book of Mormon, including its references. Then, in a second column, have them list side-by-side those same elements as taught in the Bible. Have your missionaries leave blank those elements that are missing or not taught in the Bible. It will become very evident to the missionary how the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our doctrine. This same activity can be done with the other doctrines that missionaries teach. - Identify pertinent questions of the soul for people in your mission. Invite missionaries to find answers in the Book of Mormon. > Beginning of Chapter 6 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes? (Page 129) #### Consider This - How can I develop attributes that will make me a more powerful and effective minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How will developing Christlike attributes help me fulfill my purpose as a missionary? - Which attribute do I most need to develop? ## Overview (Page 129) At the beginning of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ walked along the shore of the sea of Galilee and called out to two fishermen, Peter and Andrew. “Follow me,” He said, “and I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew 4:19; see also Mark 1:17). The Lord has also called you to His work, and He invites you to follow Him. The invitation to follow Christ is an invitation to follow His example and to become like Him. Some chapters in Preach My Gospel focus on what you need to do as a missionary—how to study, how to teach, how to manage time wisely. Just as vital as what you do, however, is who you are. The restored gospel enables you to become like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The Savior has shown the way. He has set the perfect example, and He commands us to become as He is (see 3 Nephi 27:27). Learn of Him and seek to incorporate His attributes into your life. Through the power of His Atonement, you can achieve this goal and lead others to achieve it also. The scriptures describe Christlike attributes that are essential for you to eventually develop as a missionary and throughout your life. Study the scripture passages in this chapter and look for other examples of Christlike attributes as you study other passages. Christlike attributes are gifts from God. They come as you use your agency righteously. Ask your Heavenly Father to bless you with these attributes; you cannot develop them without His help. With a desire to please God, recognize your weaknesses and be willing and anxious to improve. #### Scripture Study (Page 130) - What do these scriptures say about following Jesus Christ’s example? - 3 Nephi 12:48, John 13:1–16, 1 Peter 2:21, 3 Nephi 27:21, 27 - What is the relationship between the first principles of the gospel and Christlike attributes? - Moroni 8:25–26']","The teachings in Matthew 4:19 and Matthew 28:19 guide the setting of goals and the development of Christlike attributes in missionary work by providing a framework for action and personal growth. Matthew 28:19 emphasizes the importance of setting goals that align with the Savior’s command to teach and baptize all nations, which encourages missionaries to prayerfully set goals that help others strengthen their faith and progress in the Church. Meanwhile, Matthew 4:19, where Jesus calls His disciples to become 'fishers of men,' serves as an invitation to follow Christ’s example and develop Christlike attributes. This development is essential for fulfilling a missionary’s purpose, as it involves becoming more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, which is achieved through the power of the Atonement and righteous use of agency."
How do the teachings in D&C 8:2–3 and D&C 60:2–3 guide missionaries in using prayer and communication to effectively share the gospel and invite others to baptism?,"['<1-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##', '<2-hop>\n\nActivity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 172) - How had the man been prepared for the restored gospel? - What would have happened if the elders had never opened their mouths to share a gospel message? - Review what you did yesterday.

When you meet people, be prepared to teach brief summaries of restored truth so that the Holy Ghost can bear witness that you are the servants of the Lord. In many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet.']","The teachings in D&C 8:2–3 emphasize the role of the Holy Ghost in revealing truth through feelings and thoughts, which aligns with the guidance provided in the lesson on prayer. Missionaries are encouraged to pray sincerely, expressing gratitude and seeking confirmation of the truth of the Book of Mormon, which is a key step in knowing the truth of the Restoration. This process of prayer and receiving answers through the Holy Ghost prepares individuals to accept the gospel message. D&C 60:2–3, on the other hand, highlights the importance of opening one's mouth to share the gospel message. It promises that when missionaries speak, they will be guided by the Spirit, and their words will be powerful and effective. This scripture supports the idea that finding and teaching are interconnected activities, as missionaries are encouraged to be ready to share brief, powerful testimonies of the Restoration. Together, these teachings guide missionaries in using prayer as a means of personal revelation and communication with God, while also emphasizing the importance of actively sharing the gospel message and inviting others to be baptized, as demonstrated in the lesson's invitation to follow the example of Jesus Christ through baptism."
"How does the Atonement of Jesus Christ, including His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, relate to the principles taught in the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe Atonement (page 65) Before the world was organized, our Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ made it possible for us to overcome the effects of the Fall. All of the prophets since the world began have testified of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer. We will all suffer physical death, but Jesus Christ overcame the obstacle of physical death for us. When He died on the cross, His spirit became separated from His body. On the third day, His spirit and His body were reunited eternally, never to be separated again. He appeared to many people, showing them that He had an immortal body of flesh and bone. The reuniting of body and spirit is called resurrection and is a gift promised to each of us. Because of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, we will all be resurrected regardless of whether we have done good or evil in this life. We will have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones that will never again be subject to disease, pain, or death. The resurrection makes it possible to return to God’s presence to be judged but does not guarantee that we will be able to live in His presence. To receive that blessing, we must also be cleansed from sin. God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to overcome the obstacle of sin in addition to the obstacle of physical death. We are not responsible for the Fall of Adam and Eve, but we are responsible for our own sins. God cannot look on sin with any degree of allowance, and sin prevents us from living in His presence. Only through the Savior’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin so that we can live with God again. This is possible through exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. To fulfill the plan of salvation, Christ paid the penalty for our sins. He alone was able to do that. He was called and prepared in pre-earth life. He was the literal Son of God in the flesh. He was sinless and completely obedient to His Father. Though tempted, He never gave in to temptation. When the Father asked His Beloved Son to pay the price of the world’s sins, Jesus was prepared and willing. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and His suffering and death on the cross, and it ended with His Resurrection. Though He suffered beyond comprehension—so much so that He bled from every pore and asked whether it were possible that this burden be lifted from Him—He submitted to the Father’s will in a supreme expression of love for His Father and for us. This triumph of Jesus Christ over spiritual death by His suffering and over physical death by His Resurrection is called the Atonement. Christ promises to forgive our sins on the condition that we accept Him by exercising faith in Him, repenting, receiving baptism by immersion, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and striving faithfully to keep His commandments to the end of our lives. Through continuing repentance, we may obtain forgiveness and be cleansed of our sins by the power of the Holy Ghost. We are relieved of the burden of guilt and shame, and through Jesus Christ we become worthy to return to the presence of God. As we rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In paying the penalty for our sins, Jesus did not, however, eliminate our personal responsibility. We must show that we accept Him and that we will follow His command- ments. Only through the gift of the Atonement can we return to live with God. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nThe Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Page 45) ## Your Purpose (Page 45) As you teach, prepare your investigators to meet the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the baptismal interview questions. This is best accomplished by inviting your investigators to make and keep the commitments listed below. ### Baptismal Interview Questions (Page 45) - Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father? - Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world? - Do you believe that the Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith? - Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God? What does this mean to you? ### Commitments (Page 45) - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Other commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. > Lesson one: First Principle ## God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father (Page 45) God is our Heavenly Father. We are His children. He has a body of flesh and bone that is glorified and perfected. He loves us. He weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right. He wants to communicate with us, and we can communicate with Him through sincere prayer. He has given us this experience on the earth so we can learn and grow. We can show our love for Him through our choices and our obedience to His commandments. Heavenly Father has provided us, His children, with a way to be successful in this life and to return to live in His presence. However, we must be pure and clean through obedience in order to do so. Disobedience moves us away from Him. Central to our Father’s plan is Jesus Christ’s Atonement. The Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane as well as His suffering and death on the cross. Through the Atonement we can be freed from the burden of our sins and develop faith and strength to face our trials. ### Belief about God (Page 46) Determine what each person you are teaching understands regarding Christian beliefs about God. Many people in today’s world either have no concept of God or a very different perception of Deity. Two Book of Mormon missionaries, Ammon and Aaron, taught people who did not have a Christian background. They taught simple truths and invited their investigators to pray. Lamoni and his father were converted. Read Alma 18:24–40 and 22:4–23, and answer the questions below: - What did these missionaries teach about the nature of God? - How can you follow their examples? #### Scripture Study (Page 46) **What is the nature of God the Father and Jesus Christ?** Study the following scriptures to find answers to the question. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 1 Nephl 17:36 | 3 Nephl 27:13-22 | John 3:16-17 | | 2 Nephi 9:6 | D&C 38:1-3 | Acts 17:27-29 | | Mosiah 4:9 | D&C 130:22 | Romans 8:16 | | 3 Nephi 12:48 | Moses 1:39 | Hebrews 12:9 | | 3 Nephi 14:9-11 | Matthew 5:48 | 1 John 4:7-9 | > Lesson Two: Second Principle ##']","The Atonement of Jesus Christ, which includes His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, is central to the principles taught in the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Atonement made it possible for us to overcome the effects of the Fall and be cleansed from sin, allowing us to return to God's presence. This aligns with the teachings of the Restoration, which emphasize the importance of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of the world. The Restoration also highlights the need for individuals to exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, be baptized, and receive the Holy Ghost to fully benefit from the Atonement. These principles are foundational to the gospel as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, underscoring the significance of the Atonement in achieving eternal unity and spiritual growth."
How do the teachings in Alma 12:31 and Alma 32:1-16 relate to the principles of obedience and humility in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nLearn about the Commandments and Commitments (Page 86) As you study this lesson, follow the pattern below: - Study the section that describes the commandment and write a simple lesson plan with three to five main points. - Teach a two- or three-minute version to your companion. Practice how you will extend each commitment invitation and how you will resolve concerns. - Discuss ways to follow through on each commitment that investigators have accepted. ## Obedience (Page 86) God gives us commandments for our benefit. They are instructions from a loving Father in Heaven to help us have happy lives. He also gives us agency, or the ability and opportunity to choose between good and evil. When we obey God, we follow the influence of the Spirit and choose to conform to His will. Obedience to the commandments brings us peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. Obedience shows our love for God. Disobedience brings us sorrow. Heavenly Father knows our weaknesses and is patient with us. He blesses us as we strive to obey His commandments. He expects us to obey Him so He can bless us. #### Scripture Study (Page 86) - Agency: 2 Nephi 2:26-29, Alma 12:31, D&C 58:26-29, D&C 82:8-10, Topical Guide, “Agency” | - Obedience: D&C 130:20-21, John 14:15, 21, Ecclesiastes 12:13 **Commitment** - Will you obey the laws of God? ##', '<2-hop>\n\nHumility (Page 134) Humility is willingness to submit to the will of the Lord and to give the Lord the honor for what is accomplished. It includes gratitude for His blessings and acknowledgment of your constant need for His divine help. Humility is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of spiritual strength. When you humbly trust Him and acknowledge His power and mercy, you can have the assurance that His commandments are for your good. You are confident that you can do whatever the Lord requires of you if you rely on Him. You are also willing to trust His chosen servants and follow their counsel. Humility will help you as you strive to be obedient, to work hard, and serve selflessly. The opposite of humility is pride, which is condemned in the scriptures. To be prideful means to put greater trust in oneself than in God or in His servants. It also means to put the things of the world above the things of God. Prideful people take honor to themselves rather than giving God the glory. Pride is competitive; those who are prideful seek to have more and presume they are better than other people. Pride usually results in feelings of anger and hatred, and it is a great stumbling block. #### Scripture Study (Page 135) - What does it mean to be humble? | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | 2 Nephi 9:28-29 Mosiah 4:11-12 | Alma 5:26-29 Alma 26:12 | Matthew 26:39 Topical Guide, “Humility, Humble” | | What blessings do you receive when you humble yourself? | | | | Alma 32:1-16 | D&C 67:10 | Matthew 23:12 | | Ether 12:27 | D&C 112:10 | | | D&C 12:8 | D&C 136:32-33 | | | How can you recognize pride in yourself? | | | | 1 Nephi 15:7-11 | 2 Timothy 3:1-4 | Proverbs 15:10 | | 1 Nephi 16:1-3 | Proverbs 13:10 | Proverbs 28:25 | ## Diligence (Page 135) Diligence is steady, consistent, earnest, and energetic effort in doing the Lord’s work. The Lord expects you to work diligently—persistently and with great effort and care. A diligent missionary works effectively and efficiently. Diligence in missionary work is an expression of your love for the Lord and His work. When you are diligent, you find joy and satisfaction in your work. Do many good things of your own free will (see D&C 58:27). Don’t wait for your leaders to tell you what to do. Continue until you have done all you can, even when you are tired. Focus on the most important things and avoid wasting time. Pray for guidance and strength. Plan regularly and effectively. Avoid anything that distracts your thoughts or actions. “I have often said one of the greatest secrets of missionary work is work! If a missionary works, he will get the Spirit; if he gets the Spirit, he will teach by the Spirit; and if he teaches by the Spirit, he will touch the hearts of the people and he will be happy. There will be no homesickness, no worrying about families, for all time and talents and interests are centered on the work of the ministry. Work, work, work—there is no satisfactory substitute, especially in missionary work.” – PRESIDENT EZRA TAFT BENSON THE TEACHINGS OF EZRA TAFT BENSON (1988), 200 #### Scripture Study (Page 136) - What does it mean to be diligent? - Moroni 9:6 D&C 10:4, D&C 107:99–100 - Why does the Lord expect you to be diligent?']","Alma 12:31 discusses the concept of agency, which is closely tied to obedience. It emphasizes that God gives commandments for our benefit, allowing us to choose between good and evil. Obedience to these commandments is a demonstration of our love for God and brings peace and eternal life. On the other hand, Alma 32:1-16 highlights the importance of humility, which involves submitting to the Lord's will and recognizing our need for His help. Humility is not a weakness but a spiritual strength that enables us to trust in God's commandments and follow His chosen servants. Together, these teachings underscore the importance of being obedient and humble in missionary work, as they help missionaries align with divine guidance and effectively teach the gospel."
How does the story of Nephi and the brass plates in 1 Nephi 3–5 illustrate the principles of obedience and diligence in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 148) ### Personal Study (Page 148) - Review the suggestions in this chapter. Identify a suggestion you have not yet tried, and set a goal to try it for the next few days. - At your next district meeting, ask an experienced missionary with good language ability what he or she has done to learn the language. - Read and discuss the following statement by Elder Richard G. Scott: “Where . . . national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God, set them aside. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished” (“Removing Barriers to Happiness,” Ensign, May 1998, 87).

Obedience is the first law of heaven. It is an act of faith. You may sometimes be required to do things you do not completely understand. As you obey, you increase in faith, knowledge, wisdom, testimony, protection, and freedom. Strive to be obedient to the Lord, the living prophet, and your mission president. “The discipline contained in daily obedience and clean living and wholesome lives builds an armor around you of protection and safety from the temptations that beset you as you proceed through mortality.” – ELDER L.

Nephi's determination to obtain the brass plates, as instructed by the Lord, exemplifies obedience as he willingly undertakes a difficult task without fully understanding the outcome. This mirrors the expectation for missionaries to keep commandments and follow mission rules as acts of faith, as highlighted in the context. Additionally, Nephi's persistence in the face of adversity reflects the principle of diligence, which is emphasized in missionary work as there is no satisfactory substitute for hard work. Nephi's story serves as a powerful example of how obedience and diligence can lead to spiritual growth and success in fulfilling divine assignments."
"What is the process for ensuring accurate records of baptisms and confirmations, and how does the Confirmation Record play a role in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\nActivity: Personal Study (Page 222) Think about how you might feel if you were being interviewed. Consider the following questions: - What aspects of the interview might be strange to you? What could the interviewer do or say to put you at ease? - How would you want the interviewer to interact with you? - How would you want the interviewer to respond if you expressed doubts or misunderstandings or if you confessed serious sins? Write your answers to these questions in your study journal. ## Complete the Baptism Record (Page 222) The missionary who conducts the interview should fill out a current Baptism Record according to the instructions on the form. He should explain that a membership record is created from the Baptism Record and will contain important information about the new members and the ordinances they have received. Whenever members move, the membership record is forwarded to the new unit so that their new bishop can provide fellowship and assistance. The missionary should ask the candidate to verify the information on the form during the interview. The missionary who conducts the interview should bring the Baptism Record to the baptismal service and give it to the person who is presiding. The bishop ensures that a Confirmation Record/Baptism and Confirmation Certificate form is filled out for each candidate according to instructions on the form. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (page 222) Study Mosiah 6:1–3 and Moroni 6:1–4. How do these passages relate to your responsibility for keeping accurate records of baptisms and confirmations? ## The Baptismal Service (Page 222) The Spirit is manifest strongly as the sacred ordinances of baptism and confirmation are performed. The baptismal service and subsequent confirmation should be spiritual highlights for new converts. You and the ward mission leader should do everything you can to ensure that the baptismal service is organized, inspiring, and memorable. These services should strengthen the new converts in their commitment to remain active. Invite the bishopric, quorum and auxiliary leaders, and home teachers and visiting teachers (if assigned) to attend the baptismal service. The friends and relatives of the converts and all of your current investigators should be invited to attend the baptismal service and the sacrament meeting where the confirmation takes place. These experiences will help them feel the Spirit and prepare them to accept an invitation to learn more about the gospel. Work with the baptismal candidate and ward mission leader to invite the candidate’s friends and relatives to attend. Then follow through after the service to discuss their experience and invite them to learn why their friend chose to be baptized. The missionaries who taught the baptismal candidate coordinate with the ward mission leader to organize the service. Explain to the baptismal candidate what is planned and why. Discuss proper dress, including how the candidate will be given white clothing to wear for the baptism. Agree on the place and time for the baptism. A member of the bishopric or the ward mission leader normally conducts the service. Following are essential items to plan and organize. A baptismal service may include: 1. Prelude music. 2. A brief welcome by the priesthood leader conducting the service (a member of the bishopric should preside). 3. An opening hymn and prayer. 4. One or two short talks on gospel subjects, such as baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. 5. A musical selection. 6. Performance of the baptism. 7. A time of reverence while the people who participate in the baptism change into dry clothes. This could include listening to interlude music, singing well-known hymns and Primary songs, showing a Church audiovisual product, or bearing testimony. 8. An opportunity for new converts to bear their testimonies, if desired. 9. A closing hymn and prayer. 10. Postlude music. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBaptism and Confirmation: Questions and Answers (Page 220) 1. Who conducts the interview for baptism? Normally the district leader interviews baptismal candidates taught by missionaries in his district, including candidates taught by his zone leaders. The zone leader interviews candidates taught by the district leader. The mission president or someone he assigns must interview people involved in serious sins. District or zone leaders do not interview baptismal candidates outside their own district or zone unless the mission president assigns them to do so. 2. What is the definition of a convert baptism? Convert baptisms are baptisms of: - Persons ages nine and older who have never before been baptized and confirmed as members of the Church. - Children age eight whose parents are both nonmembers or whose parents are being baptized and confirmed at the same time as the child. 3. Do I need permission to baptize a minor child? Before you can teach and baptize an investigator who is under legal age, you must obtain permission of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s), preferably in writing. In addition, you should have good reason to believe that the child understands the baptismal covenant and will make every effort to keep it through obedience to the gospel, including faithfully attending Church meetings. 4. Do I need permission of the spouse in order to baptize a husband or wife? Yes. Do not baptize a married person without the consent of his or her spouse. 5. If the father in a family is not ready for baptism, should I baptize the family or wait until the father is ready? If the father of a family is not ready for baptism and confirmation but other family members are, you may tell the father you prefer not to baptize the family without him because the Church respects the head of the home and because family members will progress in the gospel best as a family unit. If the father continues to decline, you may baptize and confirm other family members with his consent. 6. Is it a good idea to ordain a father to the Aaronic Priesthood immediately after baptism so that he can baptize other family members? No. The father must be confirmed in a sacrament meeting and, after an interview with the bishop, be sustained to receive the Aaronic Priesthood. Baptisms of family members should not be delayed so that the father can perform the baptisms himself. 7. May I teach and baptize a person who has been excommunicated? Baptisms of excommunicated persons are not convert baptisms, and missionaries do not interview such persons for baptism. You may work with such persons only under the close supervision of the mission president and bishop. 8. What if a person has a scheduled baptismal date but is not keeping all of the commitments? If you feel that someone you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule a baptismal interview until the investigator is keeping the commitments and meets the standards. 9. What do I do when people want to be baptized but are living together without being married? Baptismal candidates who have been living with a person of the opposite gender out of wedlock must either marry or stop living together before they can be baptized. 10. Question 4 in the baptismal interview asks if a person has been involved in a serious sin, such as an abortion, a homosexual relationship, or a serious crime. What should I do if someone confesses such a sin? - **Instructions for teaching missionaries.** Sometimes investigators may volunteer information about such sins as you teach about the commandments and invite them to make commitments. However, if they do not say anything but you think they may have a problem, prepare them for the baptismal interview by asking them if they have been involved in any of these sins. If you become aware of a serious sin, do not ask about the details of the sin. Do not schedule a baptismal date or make any promises about whether they will be cleared for baptism and confirmation. Express your love and review the principle of repentance. Kindly explain that these sins are serious and that a person with more maturity and experience (your mission president or someone he assigns) will talk with them and help them with these matters. Then send a baptismal interview request directly to the mission president. - **Instructions for the person conducting the interview for baptism.** If the missionaries have properly taught the candidate before the baptismal interview, these issues, if they exist, should have been directed to the mission president. If they do arise, express your love and review the commandments and the principle of repentance. Kindly explain that these sins are serious and that a person with more maturity and experience (your mission president or someone he assigns) will talk with them and help them with these matters. Then forward a baptismal interview request directly to the mission president. ####']","The process for ensuring accurate records of baptisms and confirmations involves several steps. Initially, the missionary conducting the interview fills out a current Baptism Record, which is used to create a membership record containing important information about the new members and the ordinances they have received. This record is forwarded to the new unit whenever members move, allowing the new bishop to provide fellowship and assistance. During the baptismal service, the bishop ensures that a Confirmation Record/Baptism and Confirmation Certificate form is filled out for each candidate according to the instructions on the form. This Confirmation Record is crucial as it documents the sacred ordinances performed and helps maintain accurate church membership records, facilitating the spiritual growth and unity of the members."
"How can missionaries use the story of Nephi and the brass plates from 1 Nephi 3–5 to enhance their teaching and personal growth, and what role does the Spirit play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 16) Examine the picture of the tree of life and as you study the vision of the tree of life found in 1 Nephi 8 and 11. In this vision, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God (see 1 Nephi 11:21–22). - In the vision, what did the people need to do to be able to partake of the fruit? What do we need to do to receive all the blessings of the Atonement? In what ways do commitments and covenants help us partake of these blessings? - As a missionary, what is your duty in helping others find and partake of the fruits of the gospel? - What did Lehi desire after he had eaten the fruit? (See 1 Nephi 8:10–18.) ## The Gospel Blesses Families (Page 17) The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for families: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one Strive to find and teach families - a father, mother, and children, who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority. ## Teaching by the Spirit (Page 17) Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead. He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth. As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will: - Teach you new truths and bring the doctrines you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26). - Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see D&C 84:85). - Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1). - Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see D&C 100:5–8). - Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7). The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others. As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should: - Pray for the Spirit (see D&C 42:14). - Purify your heart (see D&C 112:28). - Keep the commandments (see D&C 20:77, 79). - Diligently treasure up God’s word (see D&C 11:21; 84:85). - Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see D&C 50:13–22). - Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7). You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord. Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 148) ### Personal Study (Page 148) - Review the suggestions in this chapter.

This exercise helps them internalize the principles of faith, obedience, and perseverance demonstrated by Nephi, which are crucial for effective missionary work. Additionally, the role of the Spirit is essential in this process, as it provides divine power to teach and testify of the truth. By praying for the Spirit, purifying their hearts, keeping the commandments, and diligently treasuring up God’s word, missionaries can ensure that the Spirit will guide them in their teaching, helping them to discern the needs of those they teach and to convey their message in a way that builds faith in others."

People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars. #### Scripture Study (Page 68) - Resurrection and Restoration: 2 Nephi 9:14–15, Jacob 6:8–9,Alma 42:13–15, 22–23 - Judgment: 2 Nephi 28:23, Mosiah 3:23–25, Alma 5:15–21, Alma 12:12–14, D&C 132:12; 137:9 John 5:22 - Kingdoms of Glory: 3 Nephi 28:10, D&C 76: Introduction, D&C 76, D&C 137, Matthew 5:48, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40 - Eternal Life: 2 Nephi 31:17–21, D&C 14:7, D&C 29:43–44, D&C 45:8, D&C 93:19, John 3:16, John 17:3 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 68) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 69) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 69) The plan of salvation teaches us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. It maps our eternal journey through premortality, mortal life, death, resurrection, and to our life in the eternities. The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him. The plan focuses on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ in overcoming the effects of the Fall and making eternal life possible for us. We invite you to ponder and pray about this message. - Pre-Earth Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us - The Creation - Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve - Our Life on Earth - The Atonement - The Spirit World - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality - Kingdoms of Glory **Commitments:** - Will you pray to know that what we have taught is true? - Will you repent of your sins? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nYou are called to teach the restored gospel to as many people as will receive you. Teaching is central to everything you do. You develop Christlike attributes, study the missionary lessons, improve your ability to speak in your mission language, and rely on the Spirit in order to teach with convincing power. The Lord stated this very simply as a commandment with a promise: “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the [missionary lessons] but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). Learn to rely on the Spirit to give you what you should say and do. By studying, developing, and using the teaching skills in this chapter, you will become a more capable instrument in the hands of the Lord. The Spirit will draw upon the knowledge and skills you have developed to help you teach more powerfully. The quality and power of your teaching will help others understand and feel the importance the restored gospel has for them. Their understanding will be influenced by your personal worthiness. Their understanding will also be influenced by how well you focus your attention on them, by how well you explain the gospel, use the scriptures, share your testimony, ask questions, and invite them to make and keep commitments. #### Follow the Spirit (Page 190) “The Spirit is the most important single element in this work. With the Spirit magnifying your call, you can do miracles for the Lord in the mission field. Without the Spirit, you will never succeed regardless of your talent and ability” (Ezra Taft Benson, seminar for new mission presidents, 25 June 1986). #### Invite the Spirit (Page 190) The following suggestions will help you invite the Spirit as you teach: - Pray. - Use the scriptures. - Bear testimony. - Share experiences. - Express love for the Lord and for others. ##']","D&C 132:12 emphasizes the importance of accepting the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to achieve eternal life, which is a central goal for Latter-day Saint missionaries as they teach about the plan of salvation and the different kingdoms of glory. This scripture underscores the necessity of living according to gospel principles to attain the highest kingdom, the celestial kingdom, which is compared to the glory of the sun. On the other hand, D&C 11:21 instructs missionaries to first seek to obtain the word of God before declaring it, promising that by doing so, they will have the Spirit and the power of God to convince others. This guidance is crucial for missionaries as they strive to teach with the Spirit, ensuring that their message resonates with those they teach and helps them understand the importance of the restored gospel in achieving eternal life. Together, these teachings guide missionaries in their efforts to help individuals progress spiritually and prepare for the blessings of the celestial kingdom."
"How do the teachings of Moses, specifically the Ten Commandments, relate to the missionary approach of sharing the restored gospel as described in the context?","['<1-hop>\n\nKeep the Ten Commandments (Page 90) Heavenly Father gives us commandments so that we will know what to do and what to avoid in order to receive the blessings He wants to give us (joy, peace of conscience, lasting happiness). God revealed to Moses the Ten Commandments to guide His people: - “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3). Other “gods” can include possessions, power, or prominence. - “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” (Exodus 20:4). - “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” (Exodus 20:7). - “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8). - “Honour thy father and thy mother” (Exodus 20:12). - “Thou shalt not kill” (Exodus 20:13). - “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:14). - “Thou shalt not steal” (Exodus 20:15). - “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” (Exodus 20:16). - “Thou shalt not covet” (Exodus 20:17). The Ten Commandments are still valid today. They teach us to worship and show reverence for God. They also teach us how to treat one another. #### No Other Gods (Page 90) People in many cultures own or pay respect to objects that remind them of Deity or ancestors. Sometimes those objects, such as statues, religious emblems, or small shrines, might also be the focus of their worship. Help them understand that the Lord has commanded us not to worship idols. Encourage them to remove from their home any object they worship or to which they pray. Help them focus their faith and worship on their Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Teach them that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ focuses on the living Christ. In the restored gospel the Lord has taught us how to remember Him. We remember Him through prayer, the sacrament, and temple worship. Your mission president will provide guidance in specific areas. #### Scripture Study (Page 91) - Mosiah 13, D&C 59:5–6, Matthew 22:36–40, Exodus 20:1–17, Deuteronomy 5:6–21 **Commitment** - Will you keep the Ten Commandments? ## Live the Law of Chastity (Page 91) God delights in chastity and hates sexual sin. Chastity includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one’s spouse after marriage. Those who live the law of chastity enjoy the strength that comes from self-control. They enjoy confidence and trust in their family relationships. They can enjoy more fully the influence of the Holy Ghost in their lives. Those who break this law are subject to a lasting sense of shame and guilt that burdens their lives. Chastity requires faithfulness in thought and action. We must keep our thoughts clean and be modest in our dress, speech, and actions. We must avoid pornography in any form. We should treat the God-given procreative power and our bodies as sacred. Baptismal candidates are to live the law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman. They are not to participate in abortions or homosexual or lesbian relations. Those who have committed sexual sin can repent and be forgiven.', '<2-hop>\n\nIn many situations, you will need to be able to present a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences: *""After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to . . .""* If a little more time is available, you might say more: *""Our message is simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrines and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.* Avoid the tendency to say things such as, *“Do you have a few minutes that we could teach you a message about . . .”* Rather, develop the habit of immediately beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost. Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching investigators, working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 173) - Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons. Think of ways to teach this lesson in a finding setting. - Determine how you can quickly connect this message to the Restoration. - Share the message with your companion. - Set a goal to teach this message at an appropriate time today to add a new investigator to your teaching pool. - Review a list of people you are currently teaching. Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked. Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group. In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits. ##']","The teachings of Moses, particularly the Ten Commandments, serve as foundational principles that guide individuals in worshiping God and treating one another with respect and integrity. These commandments, such as having no other gods, not making graven images, and honoring one's parents, emphasize devotion to God and ethical behavior. In the missionary context, these principles align with the approach of sharing the restored gospel, which focuses on the love and concern of God for His children. Missionaries are encouraged to testify of the Restoration, which includes the teachings of prophets like Moses, and to invite others to learn about the restored truths through the Book of Mormon. This approach is designed to help individuals understand how to return to God by following His commandments and embracing the restored gospel, thereby enhancing their spiritual growth and application of gospel principles in their lives."
"How does D&C 8:10 relate to the importance of prayer in missionary work, and what role does D&C 84:61 play in bearing testimony?","['<1-hop>\n\nPray with Faith (Page 107) You can teach in the Lord’s way only by the power of the Spirit, and you receive the Spirit through the prayer of faith. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (D&C 42:14). As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” (2 Nephi 33:1). President Gordon B. Hinckley illustrated this principle by relating an experience from his mission: “I always remember two young men who served in my mission. One was a superstar. He was educated. He was bright. He was quick. He was a little arrogant. We had another who was a sign painter. He came from a sign shop with very little education, but he knew his inadequacies and he relied on the Lord. When he prayed, you knew he was talking with the Lord. It wasn’t a rote thing, it was a conversation and that young man accomplished wonders while the other young man went through the motions. The power that was in the one and the absence of power in the other was so apparent. Call upon the Lord. He has extended the invitation, and He will answer” (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 469). Strive to pray sincerely, with real intent, and with “all the energy of heart” (Moroni 7:48). Effective prayer requires great effort (see Moroni 10:3–4; D&C 8:10; 9:7). Give serious thought to your attitude and to the words you use. Consider the following when you pray: - Use the language of prayer, which shows that you love and respect your Heavenly Father. Use proper and respectful language in whatever language you speak. For example, in English use scriptural pronouns such as Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine. - Always express gratitude for your blessings. A conscious effort to be grateful will help you recognize how merciful the Lord has been in your life. - Pray specifically for the guidance and help of the Holy Ghost. Show that you value this blessing by being sensitive to and aware of spiritual promptings. Then courageously follow those promptings. - Pray with love and charity. Pray for people by name. Ask for inspiration to help you understand and meet their needs. Pray for the welfare of contacts, investigators, new converts, and less-active members. Pray for the members and priesthood and auxiliary leaders in your area. Pray for your family at home. Pray for your companion, other missionaries, and your mission president. Pray to know how you can help others, and then be willing to sacrifice in their behalf. - Pray that you will be shown where to go and what to do. Pray that you will be led to those who are prepared to receive the message of the Restoration. Pray that you will recognize them. - Recognize that your Heavenly Father knows what you need better than you do. Rely on the Spirit to know what to pray for (see 3 Nephi 19:24; D&C 46:28, 30). - In your prayers at night, give the Lord an accounting of your day’s activities. Then review with Him your plan for the next day. Listen for the promptings of the Spirit. - Pray to overcome temptation. Yielding to temptation interferes with the Spirit. - Pray and, when appropriate, fast for special blessings. - Pray about and ponder the scriptures. The scriptures open the window to revelation. - Believe that God will answer your prayers. Recognize that God’s thoughts are not your thoughts (see Isaiah 55:8–9), and trust God to answer your prayers in His own way and in His own time. “Every morning . . . , missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will be teaching. If they will do this, a new light will come into their lives. There will be greater enthusiasm for the work. They will come to know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking in His behalf. They will find a different response from those they teach. As they do so by the Spirit, their investigators will respond under the influence of the same Spirit.” – PRESIDENT GORDON B. HINCKLEY “MISSIONARY SERVICE,” FIRST WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP TRAINING MEETING, 11 JAN. 2003, 20', '<2-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 214) - What are some principles and promises of bearing testimony? - 2 Nephi 33:1, D&C 62:3, D&C 84:61, D&C 100:5–8, John 15:26 ## Follow Up (Page 214) Extending an invitation without following up is like beginning a journey without finishing it or buying a ticket to a concert without going into the theater. Without the completed action, the commitment is hollow. Change can be hard. Your role is to help strengthen people in their resolve to change. You should do all you can to help people keep their commitments. Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time especially for commandments such as chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and tithing. As you and ward leaders work with people to help them keep their commitments, show understanding. Be patient but persistent. You have not finished your ministry until people are living these commitments, or in other words, until they have repented (see 3 Nephi 18:32). Sometimes several visits may be necessary for you to help people develop strong enough faith in a principle to lead to repentance. Following up begins when you first visit and teach people: - Have them write their commitment on something you leave with them, such as a pamphlet or a card with your names and phone number. - Make sure people know that you will make brief, daily visits between teaching appointments. Explain that your purpose is to support and help them. Give them an idea of what you will do during those visits. - Make specific notes in the Notes/To Do List section of your planner to follow up tomorrow on every commitment invitation you have extended today. Make frequent contact, daily if possible, to find out how people are progressing with their commitments, answer questions, help them overcome challenges, teach additional lessons, read together from the Book of Mormon, share passages of scripture, or use audiovisual materials. As you visit people often, you will strengthen the spiritual feelings they felt as you taught them the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital. There may be times when you call the investigators to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment. Help investigators identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message. Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments. Investigators are changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are with them. Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings. #### Activity: Personal or Companion Study (Page 215) - Write in your daily planner your plans for daily contact with each investigator. Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with investigators. - Choose one commitment invitation you will extend when you teach the lessons. Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment. Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns. #### Remember This (Page 215) - Focus on inviting people to make commitments in every finding or teaching situation, both with those who are not members of the Church and with Church members. - Extend commitment invitations to help people experience conversion. - Promise blessings. - Bear testimony. - Follow through to help people keep commitments. ##']","D&C 8:10 emphasizes the necessity of praying with faith to receive the Spirit, which is crucial for teaching in the Lord's way. This aligns with the guidance for missionaries to pray sincerely and with real intent, as effective prayer is essential for the Spirit to carry teachings to the hearts of others. D&C 84:61, on the other hand, highlights the principles and promises associated with bearing testimony, which is a vital part of missionary work. Bearing testimony, supported by the Spirit, helps strengthen the resolve of individuals to change and keep commitments, thus facilitating their conversion and repentance."
"Why was the restoration of the gospel necessary after the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles, and how does personal spiritual study help missionaries understand this need?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe Great Apostasy (Page 50) Investigators must understand that a universal apostasy occurred following the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. If there had been no apostasy, there would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As guided by the Spirit, teach investigators about the Great Apostasy at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. **Key Points** - The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see Ephesians 2:19–20; 4:11–14). These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer upon others the priesthood authority. - People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see Matthew 24:9; 1 Nephi 11:32–34; 2 Nephi 27:5). With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation ceased, and doctrine became corrupted. - Even before the death of the Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. The simple doctrines and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see Isaiah 24:5). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrines from them (1 Nephi 13:26–40). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see 3 John 1:9–10). People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see 2 Timothy 4:3–4). - Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshiped according to the light they possessed and have received answers to their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). - Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy.', ""<2-hop>\n\nPersonal Study (Page 114) - Record your spiritual experiences in your journal. For example, answer questions such as: Have I understood something better as I have studied the scriptures? Have I had unusual opportunities to meet people with whom I could share a message? Have I been given words to say at the moment I needed them? Have I had strong feelings of love for the people I have met? How have my prayers been answered? - Divide a page into two columns. Label one column “What the Lord Did” and the other column “What Lehi or Nephi Did.” Read the story of the Liahona and the broken bow (1 Nephi 16:9–30) or the story of Nephi building a ship (1 Nephi 17:7–16; 18:1–6). As you read, list events from the story in the appropriate columns. Consider what the story can teach you about the nature of inspiration. - Look through your journal and find occasions when you have been led by the Spirit or have experienced revelation or another gift of the Spirit. Think about when, where, and why these experiences happened. Did you do anything in particular to prepare yourself for such an experience? How was the Lord’s hand manifest in the experience? How did you feel? What can you do to have similar experiences? Remembering these experiences can help you recognize and receive the Spirit once again. - The book of Acts in the Bible has been called the “Book of the Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles.” Read the chapter headings of the book of Acts and explain why this title may be appropriate. Find evidence to justify your explanation. - Study and ponder the following counsel. How does it relate to your daily proselyting activities? - “Tell the brethren to be humble and faithful and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord, that it will lead them aright. Be careful and not turn away the still, small voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their heart open to conviction, so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them their hearts will be ready to receive it. They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits—it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts, and their whole desire will be to do good” (quoted in Juvenile Instructor, 19 July 1873, 114). - The Prophet Joseph Smith gave this counsel to Brigham Young in a dream almost three years after Joseph Smith’s death. If you were in Brigham Young’s place and received this counsel, what would you do? - Study Alma 33:1–12; 34:17–29, 38. What questions was Alma answering? (Review Alma 33:1–2.) How did Alma answer these questions? What assurances did he give that God hears and answers prayers? - The Lord has promised that the Spirit will guide us in many important ways. As you read the following passages, identify aspects of your work that require the guidance of the Spirit. What do the commandments and promises contained in the following scriptures mean for your personal and companion study? for district meetings, zone conferences, baptismal services, and other meetings? - Praying: 3 Nephi 19:24, D&C 50:30, D&C 46:30, Romans 8:26 - Conducting meetings: Moroni 6:9, D&C 20:45, D&C 46:2 - Writing: D&C 9:9, D&C 24:6, D&C 47:4, D&C 104:81, D&C 124:4, Moses 6:6 - Read the following scripture passages (including the headings to these sections). - D&C 60:1–5, D&C 61:1–4, 21–22; D&C 62:4–8 In this account, what was very important to the Lord? What did not matter to the Lord? Consider the following statement by Elder Dallin H. Oaks: “[A person may have] a strong desire to be led by the Spirit of the Lord but . . . unwisely extends that desire to the point of wanting to be led in all things. A desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our personal choices. Personal decision making is one of the sources of the growth we are meant to experience in mortality. Persons who try to shift all decision making to the Lord and plead for revelation in every choice will soon find circumstances in which they pray for guidance and don't receive it. For example, this is likely to occur in those numerous circumstances in which the choices are trivial or either choice is acceptable. “We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us. Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it. If we do not receive guidance, we should act upon our best judgment. Persons who persist in seeking revelatory guidance on subjects on which the Lord has not chosen to direct us may concoct an answer out of their own fantasy or bias, or they may even receive an answer through the medium of false revelation” (“Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall,” Ensign, Oct. 1994, 13–14). What is the relationship between following your own judgment and relying on the Spirit?""]","The restoration of the gospel was necessary after the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles because a universal apostasy occurred, leading to the absence of presiding priesthood authority and the corruption of doctrine. Without the Apostles, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform saving ordinances, and revelation ceased. This necessitated a restoration, not a reformation, to bring back the original form of priesthood authority through divine messengers. Personal spiritual study helps missionaries understand this need by encouraging them to record and reflect on their spiritual experiences, recognize the guidance of the Spirit, and understand the importance of divine inspiration in their teaching and proselyting activities. By studying scriptures and reflecting on personal experiences, missionaries can better comprehend the significance of the restoration and the role of the Spirit in guiding their efforts."
"How do district meetings and zone conferences help missionaries improve their teaching skills and finding efforts, and what role does the mission president play in supporting these activities?","['<1-hop>\n\nDistrict Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 186) - Read and discuss the “Finding through Your Own Efforts” section. - Discuss how these ideas have helped missionaries find people to teach. - On a chalkboard, list other ideas for finding people to teach. Invite the missionaries to demonstrate their ideas. - Invite the missionaries to set personal goals for improving their finding efforts. - Create a list of finding situations. - Assign each missionary one of the situations. Allow each missionary 5 minutes to prepare how he or she would teach the message of the Restoration. Refer them to “The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ” lesson if needed. - Emphasize the importance of keeping the length of the message appropriate to the setting. For example, missionaries might spend more time teaching in a member’s home than they would teaching someone in the store. - Allow as many missionaries as time permits to teach the message of the Restoration in their assigned situation. - Teach the principles found in the “Teach When You Find, Find When You Teach” section. - Assign each missionary to prepare a one-minute message he or she could share in a finding setting. These messages should be based on the doctrine found in the missionary lessons. - Invite the missionaries to practice sharing their one-minute message with each other. You may want to set up a variety of finding settings, such as teaching in a member’s home, teaching on a doorstep, teaching on a sidewalk, or contacting a referral. Have the missionaries practice teaching in each of these settings. ### Mission President (Page 187) - Set an example of member-missionary work in your family. Share your experiences with the missionaries and members. - Counsel with priesthood leaders as to the best way for missionaries to find people to teach in your mission. - Organize missionary firesides at which you can speak to the investigators in your mission. Coordinate with local priesthood leaders to make the fireside available to members who can bring their friends. As part of these firesides, have recent converts bear testimony and tell their conversion stories before you speak. Focus your remarks on the message of the Restoration. - Share your four-generation chart with missionaries, and explain how you use it in your finding efforts. - Occasionally go with the missionaries to help them find people to teach. > Beginning of chapter 10 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Can I Improve My Teaching Skills?

Select a topic from one of the missionary lessons that you have carefully studied. Do the following: – Share two or three main points you learned from your study that were helpful in teaching that lesson. – Describe the way you approached your study that helped you discover these points (how you read, resources you used, questions you were researching, and so on). – Show how you recorded and organized the results of your study. If time permits, ask a few other missionaries to do the same. 2. This activity may be done individually or in small groups. Instruct the missionaries to select one of the following questions (or you may create some of your own questions). Have them write the question down. – Why are families so important in God’s plan? – Why do people have trials and suffering? – What is the role of the Spirit in conversion? Explain that they will have five to seven minutes to: – Find at least two scripture references that answer the question. – Write a simple interpretation of how the scriptures they chose answer the question. – Describe what they would do to remember the answer. – Describe what they would do to explore the question more deeply. Invite a few missionaries (or each group) to share their answers. Discuss their responses. 3. Ask the missionaries to write one or two questions about the gospel principles and doctrines from one of the lessons in chapter 3 for which they would like to find an answer. Invite the missionaries to share their questions with the group. For each question, discuss the following: – How will answering this question bless the life of the missionary? – How will it bless the lives of investigators? – How could a missionary find the answer? 4. Ask several missionaries to share a gospel principle that their companions have taught them. Ask them to explain the principle and how their companion taught it to them. 5. Organize missionaries into companionships or small groups. Assign each group to read one chapter from the Book of Mormon. Have each group select one idea from each of the categories in the section “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Invite the groups to apply each suggestion as they read their chapter together. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for reading and discussion. Have each group explain the suggestions they used, how well the suggestions worked, and what they learned. 6. Invite each missionary to think of a story or event in the scriptures that has meaning to him or her (such as Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, King Benjamin’s sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, or Christ’s appearance to the Nephites). Invite the missionaries to sketch or describe how they visualize the accounts they have chosen. Invite two or three missionaries to share what they visualize. Ask others to tell the stories and relate them to doctrines in one of the lessons. Read Moroni 10:3 and discuss the value of pondering deeply about spiritual knowledge. ###']","District meetings and zone conferences are designed to help missionaries improve their teaching skills and finding efforts by engaging them in activities such as discussing the 'Finding through Your Own Efforts' section, setting personal goals for finding people to teach, and practicing teaching the message of the Restoration in various settings. These meetings also involve sharing and organizing study insights, answering gospel-related questions, and applying study suggestions from the Book of Mormon. The mission president supports these activities by setting an example of member-missionary work, organizing missionary firesides, and occasionally accompanying missionaries to find people to teach. He also shares personal experiences and tools, such as a four-generation chart, to enhance the missionaries' finding efforts."
How does the principle of love and service from John 13:34–35 relate to the process of confirmation and fellowship of new converts as described in the context?,"['<1-hop>\n\nWe were coming back from district meeting, and it was the only empty seat so I sat down and started to look at my mail. Of course, the first one to be read was yours, with the baby pictures of Evan. I noticed that the eyes next to me were also looking at the pictures, and I looked over to meet eyes with an older woman. She gave me a half smile and looked out the window. She then closed her eyes like she was going to sleep. I prayed, ‘Heavenly Father, I want to talk to her. Please help me.’ A minute later she opened her eyes and sat up straight, and I quickly said, ‘Don’t you think he is cute?’ I showed her the pictures of baby Evan and started talking about families with her. I asked her about her kids, and she got teary-eyed and told me a story about how her daughter hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She cried and I cried with her. I told her about the plan of salvation and how Heavenly Father knows her and knows what she is going through. I cried and told her that I know that her daughter loves her because I am a daughter of a mother that loves me, and I love her. I explained that sometimes people make bad decisions and that her daughter has agency. She told me, smiling, ‘I bet your mother really misses you, and she will not let you go when she sees you again.’ She thanked me for talking with her and gave me her address so that we can share the gospel with her. As she was getting off the bus, she said, ‘I got on the wrong bus, but I didn’t get off. No one sat by me until you came . . . and look what happened.’ God’s plan is perfect!”* What principles from this chapter do you see in this account? Review the chapter and make a list in your study journal. Which of these principles can you try to apply today? - Read John 15:12–13; 21:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2; and Mosiah 18:8–10. How well are you fulfilling your responsibility to love and serve others? How can you improve? Write your response in your study journal. - How will people know that you are a servant of the Lord? As you ponder this question, study Moroni 7:3–5; Matthew 7:20; John 13:34–35. Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Read 3 Nephi 18:31–32; Alma 8:16; Alma 24:7–8; and Alma 32:41. Consider what these verses teach about working with former investigators. Record what you learn in your study journal and teach it to your companion. ### Companion Study (Page 185) - Using your daily planner, make plans to meet with recent converts. Ask them to share how they were prepared for the gospel. Ask questions like: When did you first come in contact with the Church? What finally convinced you to meet with missionaries? Write what you learn in your study journal. - Review each of the following topics. Using the lessons, prepare a simple finding approach. Practice teaching in a finding setting and quickly relating each topic to the Restoration. - Feeling a need for more direction and purpose in life. - Wanting to draw nearer to God. - Needing help with important decisions. - Read pages 66–68 of Our Search for Happiness and pages 59–64 of True to the Faith to better understand the doctrinal foundation of family history work. Prepare a talk on family history work, and share it with your companion. - Imagine that you and your companion are transferred into a new area. You find the area book in good condition, but you have no investigators. What would you do to add people to your teaching pool as rapidly as possible? Make plans to implement some of these ideas today. - The following idea has been successful for many missionaries and members. Read and study this idea with your companion. - Help members make a list of friends, relatives, and acquaintances with whom they could share the gospel. Review this list with the members, and help them prayerfully select someone they would like to prepare to hear the gospel. - Help them set a day by which they will (a) work to have the person or family prepared to be taught in their home or (b) do some other fellowshipping activity to prepare them. Setting a date gives members a goal and helps them exercise faith. - Help them plan what they will do between now and the date they have set. - Follow up with them regularly to support and encourage them. Invite them to share their successes and concerns. Discuss how you can apply this idea in the area in which you are serving. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nConfirmation (Page 224) A person receives the ordinance of confirmation after he or she has been baptized (see D&C 20:41). A new convert is considered a member of the Church after the ordinances of baptism and confirmation are performed (see John 3:5; D&C 33:11). New converts are confirmed in a sacrament meeting of the ward where they reside, not at the baptismal service. The bishop is responsible for seeing that confirmation occurs as soon as reasonable after baptism. The bishop or one of his counselors participates in the confirmation. The bishop may invite missionary elders who helped teach the convert to participate in the confirmation. Work closely with the bishop and the ward mission leader to make sure this essential ordinance is performed. ## After the Baptism and Confirmation (Page 224) Under the direction of the bishop, missionaries may continue to fellowship new members. Continue to teach them and review what they have been taught. Encourage and support them, read the Book of Mormon with them, and help them share the gospel with family members and friends.']","The principle of love and service from John 13:34–35, which emphasizes loving one another as a demonstration of discipleship, relates to the process of confirmation and fellowship of new converts by highlighting the importance of continued support and encouragement. After baptism and confirmation, new converts are welcomed into the Church community, where they are encouraged to grow spiritually through fellowship. This process involves missionaries and church leaders working closely with new members, teaching them, and helping them integrate into the community. This reflects the love and service that John 13:34–35 advocates, as it involves actively caring for and supporting new members in their spiritual journey, ensuring they feel loved and part of the Church family."
How do the principles of accountability in Alma 5:15–19 relate to the practice of extending commitment invitations as described in Alma 5:49?,"['<1-hop>\n\nDaily Planning Session (Page 164) Conduct a planning session at the end of each day. If you are teaching a lesson, you may be out until 9:30 p.m. Otherwise, return to your apartment by 9:00 p.m. and hold a daily planning session from 9:00 to 9:30 p.m. (Mission presidents have discretion to adjust the schedule according to local circumstances.) Apply the same principles and guidelines in a daily planning session that you follow in a weekly session but in a simpler way. Be prayerful as you discuss the lessons or topics you can study during personal and companion study time that will help you with your plan. Write these topics in the space provided on the daily schedule. Review your daily schedule. Have a meaningful activity planned for every hour of the day. During the Sunday-night planning session, total and submit your weekly Call-In Summary Report, write your weekly letter to your mission president, and finalize your goals for the coming week. Prior to leaving your apartment the next day, review your goals, plans, and schedule. Make revisions if needed. Always pray before leaving your apartment. You can tell how effective your daily plans are when you don’t need to ask others, “Now what should I do?” ## Accountability (Page 164) The principle of accountability is fundamental in God’s eternal plan. We will all stand before the Lord at the last judgment and give an accounting for what we have done with the opportunities He has given us (see Alma 5:15–19; D&C 137:9). There is much you can learn about accountability on your mission that will benefit you throughout your life. The principle of accountability will bless you if you: - Approach your goal setting and planning with the idea that you will account for your efforts to your mission leaders and to the Lord through prayer. - Feel personal responsibility for the sacred trust the Lord has given you. - Set meaningful goals. - Choose to be proactive in accounting for your work to the Lord and to your mission leaders. Don’t wait to be asked. Don’t require others to follow up with you frequently. Have a desire to account for your labor. - Accept full responsibility for your efforts. Never blame others for difficult circumstances or lack of progress. - Seek to learn from your leaders, and invite them to suggest ways you can improve. - Be motivated to do your best work. Accountability does not come only at the end of your mission. It is a principle that influences how you begin, how you think and feel about the responsibility the Lord has given you, how you approach your work, and how well you endure. The attitude you have toward your mission experience is a reflection of your love toward your Heavenly Father and His Son and your respect for the priesthood. As you pray personally and in your companionship, seek inspiration on what you should do each day. As you follow your plans, pray and ask the Lord for guidance. Have a prayer in your heart throughout the day that the Spirit will help you know where to go, what to do, and what to say. Ask yourself, “What more can I do?” In your prayer at the end of the day, give an accounting of your work. You will give an accounting each week to your mission leaders using the Call-In Summary Report. If you are a mission leader, you will receive this information from other missionaries. Show an interest in their lives and in the lives of those they teach rather than simply in numbers. Do not use these tools or the information you receive as ways to control or manipulate. The information you receive through these tools will provide you with opportunities to praise missionaries for their dedication and to see opportunities for future training. “When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.” – PRESIDENT THOMAS S. MONSON JUNE 2004 WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP TRAINING BROADCAST', '<2-hop>\n\nExtend Commitment Invitations (Page 209) As a missionary you desire the salvation of souls (see Mosiah 28:3). You know that people can come unto Christ and be saved only on conditions of repentance (see D&C 18:10–16). One way to fulfill your desires is to cry repentance (see Alma 5:49; D&C 15:6; 16:6) and boldly invite people to exercise faith unto repentance, to be baptized by water and the Spirit, and to endure faithfully to the end (see 3 Nephi 27:16–20; Mormon 7:10). Commitment is an essential part of repentance. It is the act of obligating oneself to a course of action and then diligently following through on that decision. When people are genuinely committed, they have real intent, meaning that they fully intend to do what they have committed to do. They make an unwavering and earnest decision to change. They become devoted to Christ and dedicate themselves to His gospel. Keeping their commitment is how they “truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins” (D&C 20:37). When you ask for commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting the investigator to repent. One of the best ways to help people make and keep commitments is to extend a commitment invitation. Extending and following up on commitment invitations is vital because: - People become converted as they live the principles they learn (see John 7:17) and feel the Spirit confirm that what they are doing is pleasing to their Father in Heaven. - Repentance and change will help people conquer challenges, rid themselves of shame and guilt, and experience the peace and joy of God’s forgiveness. - Keeping commitments prepares people to make and keep sacred covenants. You can show your love for the people and your faith in God’s promises by following up to help them repent and keep their commitments. The commitments required for baptism are listed in the first four lessons. The commitments related to spiritual progress after baptism and confirmation are listed in lesson 5. Be constantly aware of the need to invite people to do things that will strengthen their faith in Christ. Remember the following principles: - Every finding opportunity—with members, referrals, or personal contacting—should lead to an invitation to act, usually to learn more about the message of the Restoration. - Rarely, if ever, should you talk to people or teach them without extending an invitation to do something that will strengthen their faith in Christ. - Focus on one or more commitments when you teach. If you do not invite people to make these commitments, you are not asking them to repent and come to Christ. - As you prepare in companion study to teach a lesson, consider the needs and status of each investigator and include one or more commitments in your lesson plan. - During a lesson you may be inspired to extend commitment invitations other than those you planned. Always invite people to repent. - Be bold and confident as you invite people to make commitments (see Alma 38:12). Boldness shows your faith that obedience to the Lord’s commandments brings blessings. - People will not likely change unless they are invited to do so. #### Scripture Study (Page 210) - Why is it so vital to extend invitations? - Alma 5:62, Moroni 7:13 - Why are commitments so important? - 2 Nephi 31, Mosiah 2:41, Alma 7:14–16, Alma 32:27, D&C 14:7, D&C 20:37, John 7:17 ##']","The principles of accountability in Alma 5:15–19 emphasize the importance of being responsible for one's actions and standing before the Lord to account for the opportunities given. This relates to the practice of extending commitment invitations as described in Alma 5:49, where missionaries are encouraged to invite others to repent and commit to following Christ. Both concepts highlight the necessity of personal responsibility and commitment in spiritual growth and repentance. Accountability ensures that individuals are mindful of their actions and commitments, while extending invitations encourages others to take responsibility for their spiritual journey by committing to change and follow gospel principles."
How do the teachings in D&C 42:14 and D&C 42:22-24 guide Latter-day Saints in their spiritual practices and commitments?,"['<1-hop>\n\nPray with Faith (Page 107) You can teach in the Lord’s way only by the power of the Spirit, and you receive the Spirit through the prayer of faith. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (D&C 42:14). As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” (2 Nephi 33:1). President Gordon B. Hinckley illustrated this principle by relating an experience from his mission: “I always remember two young men who served in my mission. One was a superstar. He was educated. He was bright. He was quick. He was a little arrogant. We had another who was a sign painter. He came from a sign shop with very little education, but he knew his inadequacies and he relied on the Lord. When he prayed, you knew he was talking with the Lord. It wasn’t a rote thing, it was a conversation and that young man accomplished wonders while the other young man went through the motions. The power that was in the one and the absence of power in the other was so apparent. Call upon the Lord. He has extended the invitation, and He will answer” (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 469). Strive to pray sincerely, with real intent, and with “all the energy of heart” (Moroni 7:48). Effective prayer requires great effort (see Moroni 10:3–4; D&C 8:10; 9:7). Give serious thought to your attitude and to the words you use. Consider the following when you pray: - Use the language of prayer, which shows that you love and respect your Heavenly Father. Use proper and respectful language in whatever language you speak. For example, in English use scriptural pronouns such as Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine. - Always express gratitude for your blessings. A conscious effort to be grateful will help you recognize how merciful the Lord has been in your life. - Pray specifically for the guidance and help of the Holy Ghost. Show that you value this blessing by being sensitive to and aware of spiritual promptings. Then courageously follow those promptings. - Pray with love and charity. Pray for people by name. Ask for inspiration to help you understand and meet their needs. Pray for the welfare of contacts, investigators, new converts, and less-active members. Pray for the members and priesthood and auxiliary leaders in your area. Pray for your family at home. Pray for your companion, other missionaries, and your mission president. Pray to know how you can help others, and then be willing to sacrifice in their behalf. - Pray that you will be shown where to go and what to do. Pray that you will be led to those who are prepared to receive the message of the Restoration. Pray that you will recognize them. - Recognize that your Heavenly Father knows what you need better than you do. Rely on the Spirit to know what to pray for (see 3 Nephi 19:24; D&C 46:28, 30). - In your prayers at night, give the Lord an accounting of your day’s activities. Then review with Him your plan for the next day. Listen for the promptings of the Spirit. - Pray to overcome temptation. Yielding to temptation interferes with the Spirit. - Pray and, when appropriate, fast for special blessings. - Pray about and ponder the scriptures. The scriptures open the window to revelation. - Believe that God will answer your prayers. Recognize that God’s thoughts are not your thoughts (see Isaiah 55:8–9), and trust God to answer your prayers in His own way and in His own time. “Every morning . . . , missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will be teaching. If they will do this, a new light will come into their lives. There will be greater enthusiasm for the work. They will come to know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking in His behalf. They will find a different response from those they teach. As they do so by the Spirit, their investigators will respond under the influence of the same Spirit.” – PRESIDENT GORDON B.

[Note: A person who answers yes to either of these questions must be interviewed by the mission president before being baptized.] ## Obey the Word of Wisdom (Page 92) The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith a law of health called the Word of Wisdom. This law teaches us what foods and substances we should and should not use to maintain the health of our bodies and to keep us free from evil influences. The Lord promises blessings of health, strength, protection against evil, and greater receptiveness to spiritual truths. Remember that our bodies are sacred. We should treat them with respect and reverence. The Word of Wisdom teaches that we are to eat healthy foods. It teaches very specifically that we are to avoid harmful substances, including alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. We must also avoid harmful drugs in any form. To be baptized and confirmed, those you teach must give up these substances. People who obey the Word of Wisdom are more receptive to spiritual truths. Your mission president will answer questions about whether other specific substances in your culture are included in the Word of Wisdom. #### Overcoming Addictions (Page 92) You can best help those who are struggling to overcome smoking, alcohol, and other habits by following these principles. The suggestions below are applied particularly to the Word of Wisdom but can be adapted for other addictions as well. 1. Help the people set goals as to when and how they will live the Word of Wisdom. 2. Pray for them in your personal prayers and when you are with them. 3. Be positive and supportive—even if they relapse. 4. Continue teaching them the gospel. Teach them how to use prayer and faith as sources of strength. 5. Help them attend church regularly and develop friendships with people who live the Word of Wisdom and have overcome the same addiction. 6. As appropriate, offer to give them priesthood blessings. 7. Encourage them to remove harmful substances from their home. #### Scripture Study (Page 92) - D&C 89, 1 Corinthians 3:16–17, 1 Corinthians 6:19–20, **Commitment** - Will you live the Word of Wisdom? **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - What do you understand of the Word of Wisdom?

This guidance encourages Latter-day Saints to rely on sincere prayer to invite the Holy Ghost into their lives, thereby enhancing their ability to teach and live the gospel effectively. On the other hand, D&C 42:22-24 underscores the commitment to live the law of chastity, which is a prerequisite for baptism. This scripture instructs individuals to maintain sexual purity within the bounds of legal marriage between a man and a woman, reflecting a commitment to uphold sacred covenants. Together, these teachings guide Latter-day Saints in their spiritual practices by fostering a reliance on the Spirit through prayer and a commitment to live according to gospel principles, such as chastity, which are essential for spiritual growth and eternal unity."
"How did Moses contribute to the establishment of a new gospel dispensation, and what role does agency play in the context of apostasy?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe Gospel Blesses Families (Page 46) The restored gospel blesses and helps husbands and wives, parents and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and spiritual strength in their families. These blessings are available now and in eternity. The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current concerns and challenges. Because families are ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in eternity. God has established families to bring happiness to His children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere, and prepare them for eternal life. The home is the best place to teach, learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing family members with peace, joy, and happiness. Through prophets in every age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for individuals and families. > Lesson Three: Third Principle ## Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation (Page 46) One important way that God shows His love for us is by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the power and authority given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation. They in turn teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer. The teachings of prophets are found in sacred books called scriptures. Our Father’s plan for us to be successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus’ Atonement at the center of that plan. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can receive eternal life if we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. “This is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:21). All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to accept or reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles. Those who choose to obey are blessed, but those who ignore, reject, or distort the gospel do not receive God’s promised blessings. Whenever people choose to disregard, disobey, or distort any gospel principle or ordinance, whenever they reject the Lord’s prophets, or whenever they fail to endure in faith, they distance themselves from God and begin to live in spiritual darkness. Eventually this leads to a condition called apostasy. When widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority to teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel. Biblical history has recorded many instances of God speaking to prophets, and it also tells of many instances of apostasy. To end each period of general apostasy, God has shown His love for His children by calling another prophet and giving him priesthood authority to restore and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ anew. In essence, the prophet acts as a steward to oversee the household of God here on earth. Such periods of time headed by prophetic responsibility are called dispensations. God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to Adam and gave him priesthood authority. Adam was the first prophet on the earth. By revelation, Adam learned of mankind’s proper relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Adam and Eve taught their children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel in all aspects of their lives. Adam was followed by other prophets, but over time the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel and fell into apostasy, choosing to be unrighteous. Thus began the pattern of prophetic dispensations that makes up much of the recorded history of the Old Testament. Heavenly Father revealed His gospel through direct communication to prophets such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Each prophet was called by God to begin a new dispensation of the gospel. To each of these prophets God granted priesthood authority and revealed eternal truths. Unfortunately, in each dispensation people eventually used their agency to choose to reject the gospel and then fell into apostasy. ### Prophets (Page 48) Determine what the person you are teaching understands about prophets. In most cultures there are people who believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God as defined in the restored gospel. Explain clearly that God establishes His kingdom on the earth by calling a prophet to establish a new dispensation. He gives that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. You might wonder how gospel dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people understand that God loves His children and that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.', '<2-hop>\n\nKey Definitions (page 58) - **Agency:** The ability and privilege God gives people to choose and to act for themselves. - **Apostasy:** A turning away from the truth by individuals, the Church, or entire nations. It includes rebellion against authority and rejection of prophets. Evidence of apostasy includes transgressing God’s laws, changing gospel ordinances, and breaking covenants (see Isaiah 24:5). - **Dispensation:** A period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood. In addition to Jesus Christ, prophets such as Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Joseph Smith have each started a new gospel dispensation. When the Lord organizes a dispensation, the gospel is revealed anew so that the people of that dispensation do not have to depend on past dispensations for knowledge of the plan of salvation. The dispensation begun by Joseph Smith is known as the “dispensation of the fulness of times.” - **Priesthood:** The authority and power that God gives to man to act in the name of Jesus Christ in all things for the salvation of mankind. - **Prophet:** A man who has been called by and speaks for God. As a messenger of God, a prophet receives priesthood authority, commandments, prophecies, and revelations from God. His responsibility is to make known God’s will and true character to mankind and to show the meaning of His dealings with them. A prophet denounces sin and foretells its consequences. He is a preacher of righteousness. On occasion, a prophet may be inspired to foretell the future for the benefit of mankind. His primary responsibility, however, is to bear witness of Christ. - **Redeemer:** Jesus Christ is the great Redeemer of mankind because He, through His Atonement, paid the price for the sins of mankind and made possible the resurrection of all people. To redeem is to deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment. Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin. Jesus’ Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death. Through His Atonement, which includes His suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross as well as His Resurrection, those who have faith in Him and who repent are redeemed from spiritual death. - **Reformer:** To reform is to make changes to something in order to improve it. The term reformers refers to those men and women (such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, William Tyndale, and John Wycliffe) who protested the practices of the existing church, which they felt needed to be reformed. - **Restoration:** To restore means to return to a former condition, or to bring back. The Restoration, as used by Latter-day Saints, means that the true Church of Jesus Christ, which was lost through apostasy, was brought back as it originally existed when organized by Jesus Christ. Unlike the Reformation, the Restoration was accomplished by divine authority through revelation. - **Revelation:** Communication from God to His children on earth. Revelation may come through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost by way of inspiration, visions, dreams, or visits by angels. Revelation provides guidance that can lead the faithful to eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom. The Lord reveals His work to His prophets and confirms to believers that the revelations to the prophets are true (see Amos 3:7). Through revelation, the Lord provides individual guidance for every person who seeks it and who has faith, repents, and is obedient to the gospel of Jesus Christ. **']","Moses contributed to the establishment of a new gospel dispensation by being called as a prophet through whom God revealed eternal truths and granted priesthood authority. This allowed Moses to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ anew, ensuring that the people of his time did not have to rely solely on past dispensations for knowledge of the plan of salvation. In the context of apostasy, agency plays a crucial role as it is the ability and privilege given by God to people to choose and act for themselves. When individuals or groups use their agency to reject the gospel, transgress God's laws, or change gospel ordinances, it leads to apostasy, which is a turning away from the truth."
"How did the death of the Apostles lead to the Great Apostasy, and why was a restoration necessary according to the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ?","['<1-hop>\n\nHe gives that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. You might wonder how gospel dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people understand that God loves His children and that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. #### Scripture Study (Page 48) Study about Prophets using the following scriptures: - Jacob 4:4, 6, Mosiah 8:13–18, Acts 10:34–43, and Amos 3:7 Study about Dispensations using the following scriptures: - D&C 136:36–38, Moses 5:4–12, 55–59, Moses 8:19–30, Bible Dictionary, “Dispensations” > Lesson One: Fourth Principle ## The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement (Page 48) A few hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ, people again fell into apostasy. But when the Savior began His mortal ministry He established His Church again on the earth. Heavenly Father sent His Son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son . . . that the world through him might be saved” (John 3:16–17). Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take upon Him, by His suffering, the sins of all who would live on this earth and to overcome physical death. The Savior made an infinite atoning sacrifice so that if we have faith in Him, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end, we can receive forgiveness of our sins and enter and follow the path that will lead us to eternal life in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 31:13–21). During His earthly ministry, the Savior taught His gospel and performed many miracles. He called twelve men to be His Apostles and laid His hands on their heads to give them priest- hood authority. He organized His Church, fulfilled prophecy, and was rejected and crucified. Most important, He completed the Atonement. The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, completed all that His Heavenly Father sent Him to do. Before the Savior’s death and Resurrection, He gave His Apostles authority to teach His gospel, perform the ordinances of salvation, and establish His Church in the world. ### Scripture Study (Page 49) Articles of Faith 1:5, Matthew 10:1–10, Luke 6:13, John 15:16, and Hebrews 5:4. > Lesson one: Fifth Principle ## The Great Apostasy (Page 49) After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept the doctrines of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the doctrines were corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost. Without revelation and priesthood authority, people relied on human wisdom to interpret the scriptures and the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. False ideas were taught as truth. Much of the knowledge of the true character and nature of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was lost. The doctrines of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or forgotten. The priesthood authority given to Christ’s Apostles was no longer present on the earth. This apostasy eventually led to the emergence of many churches. After centuries of spiritual darkness, truth-seeking men and women protested against current religious practices. They recognized that many of the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel had been changed or lost. They sought for greater spiritual light, and many spoke of the need for a restoration of truth. They did not claim, however, that God had called them to be a prophet. Instead, they tried to reform teachings and practices that they believed had been changed or corrupted. Their efforts led to the organization of many Protestant churches. This Reformation resulted in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the final Restoration. The Savior’s Apostles foretold this universal apostasy. They also foretold that the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church would be restored once more upon the earth. #### Scripture Study (Page 49) Study these scriptures to learn more anout the great apostacy: - 1 Nephi 13, 2 Nephi 26:20–21, 2 Nephi 28, 4 Nephi 1:27, D&C 86:1–3, Matthew 24:9–11, Mark 12:1–9, Acts 3:19–21 - Acts 20:28–30, Galatians 1:6–9, 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 (JST verses 2, 3, 7–9), 1 Timothy 4:1–3, 2 Timothy 4:3–4, 2 Peter 2:1–2, Amos 8:11–12 - Topical Guide: “Apostasy of the Early Christian Church”, True to the Faith, “Apostasy,” pages 13–14 Our Search for Happiness, pages 23–32 Jesus the Christ, chapter 40, “The Long Night of Apostasy” ####', '<2-hop>\n\nThe Great Apostasy (Page 50) Investigators must understand that a universal apostasy occurred following the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles. If there had been no apostasy, there would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As guided by the Spirit, teach investigators about the Great Apostasy at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. **Key Points** - The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see Ephesians 2:19–20; 4:11–14). These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer upon others the priesthood authority. - People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see Matthew 24:9; 1 Nephi 11:32–34; 2 Nephi 27:5). With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation ceased, and doctrine became corrupted. - Even before the death of the Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. The simple doctrines and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see Isaiah 24:5). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrines from them (1 Nephi 13:26–40). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see Joseph Smith—History 1:19). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see 3 John 1:9–10). People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see 2 Timothy 4:3–4). - Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshiped according to the light they possessed and have received answers to their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (D&C 123:12). - Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy.']","The death of the Apostles led to the Great Apostasy because, with their passing, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church.

"How can the principles from 3 Nephi 18:31–32 be applied to support investigators struggling with addiction, as discussed in the missionary journal?","['<1-hop>\n\nWe were coming back from district meeting, and it was the only empty seat so I sat down and started to look at my mail. Of course, the first one to be read was yours, with the baby pictures of Evan. I noticed that the eyes next to me were also looking at the pictures, and I looked over to meet eyes with an older woman. She gave me a half smile and looked out the window. She then closed her eyes like she was going to sleep. I prayed, ‘Heavenly Father, I want to talk to her. Please help me.’ A minute later she opened her eyes and sat up straight, and I quickly said, ‘Don’t you think he is cute?’ I showed her the pictures of baby Evan and started talking about families with her. I asked her about her kids, and she got teary-eyed and told me a story about how her daughter hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She cried and I cried with her. I told her about the plan of salvation and how Heavenly Father knows her and knows what she is going through. I cried and told her that I know that her daughter loves her because I am a daughter of a mother that loves me, and I love her. I explained that sometimes people make bad decisions and that her daughter has agency. She told me, smiling, ‘I bet your mother really misses you, and she will not let you go when she sees you again.’ She thanked me for talking with her and gave me her address so that we can share the gospel with her. As she was getting off the bus, she said, ‘I got on the wrong bus, but I didn’t get off. No one sat by me until you came . . . and look what happened.’ God’s plan is perfect!”* What principles from this chapter do you see in this account? Review the chapter and make a list in your study journal. Which of these principles can you try to apply today? - Read John 15:12–13; 21:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2; and Mosiah 18:8–10. How well are you fulfilling your responsibility to love and serve others? How can you improve? Write your response in your study journal. - How will people know that you are a servant of the Lord? As you ponder this question, study Moroni 7:3–5; Matthew 7:20; John 13:34–35. Record your thoughts in your study journal. - Read 3 Nephi 18:31–32; Alma 8:16; Alma 24:7–8; and Alma 32:41. Consider what these verses teach about working with former investigators. Record what you learn in your study journal and teach it to your companion. ### Companion Study (Page 185) - Using your daily planner, make plans to meet with recent converts. Ask them to share how they were prepared for the gospel. Ask questions like: When did you first come in contact with the Church? What finally convinced you to meet with missionaries? Write what you learn in your study journal. - Review each of the following topics. Using the lessons, prepare a simple finding approach. Practice teaching in a finding setting and quickly relating each topic to the Restoration. - Feeling a need for more direction and purpose in life. - Wanting to draw nearer to God. - Needing help with important decisions. - Read pages 66–68 of Our Search for Happiness and pages 59–64 of True to the Faith to better understand the doctrinal foundation of family history work. Prepare a talk on family history work, and share it with your companion. - Imagine that you and your companion are transferred into a new area. You find the area book in good condition, but you have no investigators. What would you do to add people to your teaching pool as rapidly as possible? Make plans to implement some of these ideas today. - The following idea has been successful for many missionaries and members. Read and study this idea with your companion. - Help members make a list of friends, relatives, and acquaintances with whom they could share the gospel. Review this list with the members, and help them prayerfully select someone they would like to prepare to hear the gospel. - Help them set a day by which they will (a) work to have the person or family prepared to be taught in their home or (b) do some other fellowshipping activity to prepare them. Setting a date gives members a goal and helps them exercise faith. - Help them plan what they will do between now and the date they have set. - Follow up with them regularly to support and encourage them. Invite them to share their successes and concerns. Discuss how you can apply this idea in the area in which you are serving. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nA Plan for Overcoming Addictive Behavior (Page 203) Investigators and new and less-active members may ask what they can do to overcome an addiction. They trust your ability to offer guidance and support. The following suggestions may be helpful: - Have them outline the times, places, and people that contribute to the behavior. Then discuss the list with a spouse, bishop, ward missionary, or other trusted friend. Talk about what they need to do to change or avoid the items on the list. - Have them write down what the behavior is causing them to miss now and, if not corrected, what it will cause them to miss in the future. - Have them write down different things they can do to avoid or discourage inappropriate behavior. This may include talking to one’s spouse, calling the bishop or a friend for support, exercising, and any other activity that helps them avoid temptation. - Encourage them to regularly pray, study the scriptures, listen to uplifting music, and read wholesome books. - Encourage them to seek a priesthood blessing. - Encourage them to continue to be active in the Church, which is there to help them overcome their problems and grow closer to the Lord. - Encourage them to attend an appropriate support group or obtain professional help. In some places, LDS Family Services is available. - Encourage them to never give up! The Lord will assist them, even if it takes some time. Active Latter-day Saints can best help new members remain active by being their friends. Members should reach out to investigators and new members with a warm, positive attitude. Investigators and new converts will respond favorably when greeted with a smile, when sincerely asked about how they are doing, when others sit by them during meetings, and when they are invited to a family dinner or family home evening. Since it is likely that some may return to an addiction, priesthood leaders and members should not be shocked or discouraged if they learn that an investigator or new member may be struggling with such problems. They should show confidence in the individual and not be judgmental if the person yields to an old craving. They should treat it as a temporary and understandable setback. Condemning the addicted investigator or new convert is never helpful and will likely lead to discouragement, failure, and inactivity. A new convert who suddenly stops attending Church may have given in to an old addiction and is feeling unworthy and discouraged. An immediate visit giving encouragement and support can help the person succeed. Members should show in word and action that they accept the converts (see 3 Nephi 18:32). Remaining active in the Church and striving to live faithfully are the most important things any individual can do in overcoming addiction problems. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 204) Think of some habit you have—something you do frequently, without thinking, such as cracking your knuckles, adjusting your glasses, eating too much, or sleeping too late. Now try to go one day without doing it once. When you succeed, try to go a whole week without doing it. Discuss your experience with your companion. Then try to imagine how much harder it is for an investigator to conquer an addiction such as tobacco or alcohol abuse. ## Leave Something Behind (Page 204) At the conclusion of each teaching visit, provide the investigator with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. You might assign them chapters from the Book of Mormon. You might give them a brochure addressing what has been taught or what you are going to teach in your next visit, or it may be other literature or an audiovisual presentation. If they have access to the Internet, encourage them to go to www.mormon.org. They should always be given something to think about, to ponder, and to pray about. This can become an opening topic of discussion the next time you meet. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 204) Review the items you have available to leave with investigators including brochures and audiovisual items. Are there other items you need to obtain so you can share them with your investigator? Make a list in your planner of the items you need to order. Consider each of the investigators you are scheduled to teach this week. What chapters in the Book of Mormon will be most helpful to them? What other items would benefit them? Record in the Notes/To Do List in your planner what you intend to provide each investigator and what you will do to follow up in your next visit.']","The principles from 3 Nephi 18:31–32 emphasize the importance of not casting out individuals who are struggling, but rather continuing to minister to them. This aligns with the guidance provided in the missionary journal for supporting investigators and new members who are overcoming addiction. It suggests that members should not be judgmental or discouraged if someone yields to an old craving, but instead show confidence and provide encouragement. By remaining active in the Church and striving to live faithfully, individuals can overcome addiction problems. The journal also advises offering support through prayer, scripture study, and attending support groups, which reflects the compassionate approach taught in 3 Nephi 18:31–32."
"How does the practice of personal and companion study, as outlined in the missionary daily schedule, relate to the teachings in D&C 88:77 and D&C 68:27 about learning and teaching the gospel?","['<1-hop>\n\nBaptism, Our First Covenant (Page 77) Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God. God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come. Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our commitments to God. To keep our covenants, we must give up activities or interests that prevent us from honoring those covenants. For example, we give up shopping and recreational pursuits on Sunday so we can keep the Sabbath day holy. We should desire to receive worthily the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives. By keeping the commandments and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins. Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again. Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see D&C 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized. Christ set the example for us by being baptized. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17). We must be baptized to become members of the restored Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority. A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation. Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see D&C 68:27). Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the command- ments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenants. We also regularly renew the covenants we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us. ####', '<2-hop>\n\nPersonal Study, Companion Study, District Meetings, and Zone Conferences (Page 10) Effective study during your mission will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Four of your most important study opportunities are personal study, companion study, district meetings, and zone conferences. Your daily schedule includes time for personal and companion study every day. ### Missionary Daily Schedule - 6:30 a.m. Arise, pray, exercise (30 minutes), and prepare for the day. - 7:30 a.m. Breakfast. - 8:00 a.m. Personal study: the Book of Mormon, other scriptures, doctrines of the missionary lessons, other chapters from Preach My Gospel, the Missionary Handbook, and the Missionary Health Guide. - 9:00 a.m. Companion study: share what you have learned during personal study, prepare to teach, practice teaching, study chapters from Preach My Gospel, confirm plans for the day. - 10:00 a.m. Begin proselyting. Missionaries learning a language study that language for an additional 30 to 60 minutes, including planning language learning activities to use during the day. Missionaries may take an hour for lunch and additional study, and an hour for dinner at times during the day that fit best with their proselyting. Normally dinner should be finished no later than 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. Return to living quarters (unless teaching a lesson; then return by 9:30) and plan the next day’s activities (30 minutes). Write in journal, prepare for bed, pray. - 10:30 p.m. Retire to bed. \\*In consultation with the Presidency of the Seventy or the Area Presidency, your mission president may modify this schedule to meet local circumstances. What you learn in personal study will help you in companion study, district meeting, and zone conferences, where you can “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). What you gain from your study sessions and district meetings will help you teach with spiritual power. ### Personal Study (page 10) The purpose of personal study is to strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. In your personal study, focus on the standard works and the approved missionary library: - Jesus the Christ - Our Heritage - Our Search for Happiness - True to the Faith You can make personal study effective as you: - Read from the Book of Mormon and other scriptures. - Study the doctrines of the missionary lessons. - Study other chapters from Preach My Gospel. ### Companion Study (Page 11) The purpose of companion study is to (1) build unity in your companionship in order to teach by the Spirit and (2) focus on the progress of those you teach. You can make companion study effective as you: - Share insights with each other from personal study. - Prepare for specific teaching appointments, member visits, finding opportunities, and other activities. Study material that helps you teach, find, and work more effectively. Discuss the people with whom you are working. Make plans to apply what you are learning. - Throughout the day, continue to discuss the principles, goals, skills, and plans from companion study. ### District Meetings (Page 11) The purpose of district meeting is to “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (D&C 88:77). - District meetings are held each week for 60 to 90 minutes. - The district leader plans and conducts the district meeting and may invite other missionaries to help teach. - District meetings may include: – Sharing insights from personal and companion study. – Practicing the lessons in various settings. – Explaining, demonstrating, and practicing principles and skills described in Preach My Gospel. – Discussing the progress and needs of investigators. – Discussing and addressing challenges in the district. – Sharing experiences and testimonies of missionary work. - District leaders may use district meeting to receive reports regarding the efforts of missionaries in the district. They should not set goals or quotas for other missionaries.']","The practice of personal and companion study in the missionary daily schedule is designed to strengthen a missionary's knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel, which aligns with the teachings in D&C 88:77 about teaching one another the doctrine of the kingdom. This scripture emphasizes the importance of learning and teaching the gospel, which is reflected in the structured study sessions that include reading from the Book of Mormon and other scriptures, studying missionary lessons, and sharing insights with companions. Additionally, D&C 68:27 mentions the age of accountability for baptism, which is a fundamental gospel principle that missionaries learn and teach. The study sessions help missionaries prepare to meet the needs of those they teach, ensuring they can effectively communicate these doctrines, including the importance of covenants and ordinances like baptism, as outlined in the context."
"How does Moroni 10:3-5 guide individuals in seeking spiritual truths through prayer, and how can missionaries effectively incorporate this guidance into their study and teaching practices?","['<1-hop>\n\n> Lesson One: Eighth Principle ## Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost (Page 53) This message of the Restoration is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3-5. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask in prayer to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. In order to do this, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer. In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration. Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him. ### Prayer (Page 53) Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, rarely is prayer considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson. ### Guide to prayer (Page 53) - Address our Heavenly Father (“Our Father in Heaven, . ..”). - Express the feelings of your heart (gratitude, questions, requests to confirm that the Book of Mormon is true, and so on). - Close (“In the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). ### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 54) During this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed. To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost. You might say, **“As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”** The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on (date). Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” #### Scripture Study (Page 54) - Alma 5:45–46, D&C 8:2–3, John 14:26, and Introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 8–9 ##', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 29) 1.

(Page 31) ### Consider This (Page 31) - Why is it important to study the gospel? - How will my study affect those I teach? - Why do I need to continually treasure up the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How can I effectively learn the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to teach others? - How can I improve my personal and companion study? > These are questions to consider finding answers to as you study this chapter The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see D&C 131:6). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior. Effective daily study must always begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (Moroni 10:4), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (Matthew 5:6), and searching for answers to your investigators’ questions and concerns.']","Moroni 10:3-5 provides a framework for individuals to seek spiritual truths through prayer by encouraging them to read and ponder the message of the Book of Mormon and then ask Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true. This process involves addressing Heavenly Father, expressing gratitude, and asking for confirmation of the truth, with the promise that the Holy Ghost will teach them through feelings and thoughts. Missionaries can incorporate this guidance into their study and teaching practices by beginning their study with prayer, which is an act of faith and personal agency. They are encouraged to develop effective study habits that include a strong desire to learn and studying with 'real intent' as mentioned in Moroni 10:4. By doing so, they can obtain spiritual knowledge and prepare to teach others, helping those they teach to grow in their faith in the Savior. This approach aligns with the counsel to first seek to obtain the word of God before declaring it, ensuring that missionaries have meaningful learning experiences that enhance their ability to teach effectively."
How do 3 Nephi 28:10 and 3 Nephi 18:21 relate to the teachings on eternal marriage and family prayer in the context of the plan of salvation?,"['<1-hop>\n\n- Will you pray for the missionaries and for opportunities to share the gospel? - Will you prepare to serve a mission? ### Eternal Marriage (Page 99) The basic unit of the Church is the family. Within the family, people experience many of life’s greatest joys and sorrows. Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and is central to God’s eternal plan for the salvation of His children. The means by which mortal life is created is divinely appointed and is safeguarded by marriage. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to endure beyond the grave. Marriage, however, can be eternal only when authorized priesthood holders perform the sealing ordinance in sacred temples and when husbands and wives who have been sealed together keep the covenants they have made. Husbands and wives are to love each other. As they keep the commandments and live gospel principles, they are to honor their marital vows with complete fidelity (see “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102; see also D&C 42:22). Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ and when parents make their family their highest priority. “By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Together, parents are to teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ and help them live it. Satan is making a concentrated attack on families. Years ago Church leaders set aside Monday evening as a time for family home evening. Parents should use this time to teach their children the gospel, strengthen their relationships with them, and have fun together. Other ways of strengthening the family include daily family prayer and scripture study, worshiping at church as a family, and serving others. Heaven is a continuation of the ideal home. Through priesthood ordinances and righteous living, we can live as families in God’s presence eternally. #### Scripture Study (Page 99) **Marriage:** - D&C 42:22, D&C 1327, “The Family: A Proclamation to the world"" - D&C 49:15, Genesis 2:24 - D&C 131:1-4, Ephesians 5:25 **Family:** - Mosiah 4:14-15, 3 Nephi 18:21, D&C 130:2, 1Timothy 5:8, “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” **Teach Children:** - Alma 56:47, Alma 57:21, D&C 68:25-30, Moses 6:55-62, Ephesians 6:4, Proverbs 22:6 #### Commitments - Will you hold weekly family home evening, daily family prayer, daily family scripture study, and other family activities? - Will you prepare to enter the temple to (1) receive your endowment? (2) be married for time and eternity? (3) if married, be sealed for eternity as husband and wife? and (4) have your children sealed to you? - Will you worship on the Sabbath as a family? - Will you serve others? ###', '<2-hop>\n\nIn the scriptures this kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun. People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom. This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars. #### Scripture Study (Page 68) - Resurrection and Restoration: 2 Nephi 9:14–15, Jacob 6:8–9,Alma 42:13–15, 22–23 - Judgment: 2 Nephi 28:23, Mosiah 3:23–25, Alma 5:15–21, Alma 12:12–14, D&C 132:12; 137:9 John 5:22 - Kingdoms of Glory: 3 Nephi 28:10, D&C 76: Introduction, D&C 76, D&C 137, Matthew 5:48, 1 Corinthians 15:41–42, JST, 1 Corinthians 15:40 - Eternal Life: 2 Nephi 31:17–21, D&C 14:7, D&C 29:43–44, D&C 45:8, D&C 93:19, John 3:16, John 17:3 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 68) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God? We will be holding a baptismal service on [date]. Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?” ## Ideas for Teaching (Page 69) This section has ideas for you to use in preparing for and teaching this lesson. Prayerfully follow the Spirit as you decide how to use these ideas. Add the ideas you select to your lesson plan. Keep in mind that these ideas are suggestions—not requirements—to help you meet the needs of those you teach. ### Short Lesson Plan (3–5 minutes) (Page 69) The plan of salvation teaches us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. It maps our eternal journey through premortality, mortal life, death, resurrection, and to our life in the eternities. The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him. The plan focuses on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ in overcoming the effects of the Fall and making eternal life possible for us. We invite you to ponder and pray about this message. - Pre-Earth Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us - The Creation - Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve - Our Life on Earth - The Atonement - The Spirit World - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality - Kingdoms of Glory **Commitments:** - Will you pray to know that what we have taught is true? - Will you repent of your sins? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ###']","3 Nephi 28:10 is associated with the concept of the Kingdoms of Glory, which is part of the plan of salvation. It emphasizes the eternal nature of life and the potential to live in the presence of God, which aligns with the teachings on eternal marriage, where family relationships can endure beyond the grave through priesthood ordinances and righteous living. On the other hand, 3 Nephi 18:21 highlights the importance of family prayer, which is a practice that strengthens family bonds and aligns with the teachings that happiness in family life is achieved when founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ. Both scriptures underscore the significance of spiritual practices and covenants in achieving eternal life and maintaining strong family relationships as part of God's eternal plan."
"How did Brigham Young's experience with the Holy Ghost influence his conversion to the restored gospel, and how can this be applied to missionary work today?","['<1-hop>\n\n### Companion Study (Page 115) - Talk about the prayers you offer as companions. Are they guided by the Holy Ghost? Have you received answers to your prayers? When you pray as companions, do you: – Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness? – Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers? – Pray for people by name and consider their needs? – Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you? – Receive answers to your prayers? - Discuss as companions how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly. - Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost. Write comments that investigators have made about their experiences with the Spirit in learning the gospel and trying to keep commitments. How can you help others recognize this sacred influence? How can you avoid being manipulative as you do so? - Consider and discuss how the following counsel applies to you: “You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth” (Boyd K. Packer, “The Candle of the Lord,” Ensign, Jan. 1983, 53). - Discuss the following statements and how these principles can change both your prayers and your work. How can your prayers influence your planning, goal setting, work, and activities each day? “Our deeds, in large measure, are children of our prayers. Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of charting a righteous course of conduct for us” (Bruce R. McConkie, “Why the Lord Ordained Prayer,” Ensign, Jan. 1976, 12). “Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any blessing or virtue we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue” (David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life, 114–15). “Ask [God] to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it” (Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 46). ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 116) - Present a lesson on using proper and respectful language in prayer. - As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting. The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest. - Express gratitude for manifestations of the Lord’s hand in your work (see D&C 59:21). Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see Ether 3:5). - Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. - Ask a recent convert to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit as an investigator. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nIt adds a current, personal witness to the truths you have taught from the scriptures. An effective missionary teaches, testifies, and invites others to do things that build faith in Jesus Christ. This includes making promises that come from living true principles. For example, a missionary might say, “I know as you keep the Sabbath day holy, you will find more peace in your heart.” For your testimony to have convincing power, you must be sincere. Powerful testimony is not dependent on eloquence or the volume of your voice but on the conviction of your heart. Strive daily to strengthen your understanding and conviction of the doctrines and principles you are to teach. Bear testimony often to seal the truth of the principles or doctrine you are teaching. As often as possible, teach, then testify, and testify as you teach. Your testimony may be as simple as “Jesus Christ is the Son of God” or “I have learned for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.” You may also share a brief experience about how you gained this knowledge. Bear testimony several times in each lesson, not just at the end. Bear testimony that what your companion has taught is from God. Bear testimony that the principle you are going to teach will bless the investigators’ lives if they will follow it. Talk about how living a principle has blessed your life. People may sometimes intellectually question what you teach, but it is difficult to question a sincere, heartfelt testimony. When you testify, pray that those you are teaching will feel the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. When you testify, you help create an environment for investigators to feel the Holy Ghost confirming your witness of the truth. This prepares them to accept the commitments you will extend. Brigham Young was not baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the first year of his learning about the restored gospel. But of his conversion he said: “If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared, in the most exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it by learning and worldly wisdom, they would have been to me like smoke which arises only to vanish away. But when I saw a man without eloquence or talents for public speaking, who could only say, ‘I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord,’ the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my understanding, and a light, glory, and immortality were before me. I was encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself that the testimony of the man was true” (in Journal of Discourses, 1:90). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 213) The passages below are examples of bearing testimony. Read each of the questions and scriptures. Write your answers in your study journal. - In these verses, of what do the apostles and prophets testify? - How strongly do they believe what they are saying? How can you tell that they are convinced of the truth? - When you say, “I know that ________ is true,” what do you mean? What other words can you use to convey your convictions? - Jacob 7:7–12, Alma 5:45–48, Alma 34:1, 8; Acts 2:14–38, Acts 10:34–44, D&C 76:22–24, John 3:3–11 ####']","Brigham Young's conversion to the restored gospel was significantly influenced by his experience with the Holy Ghost. Despite not being baptized during the first year of learning about the gospel, he was deeply moved by the testimony of a man who, without eloquence or public speaking talents, declared, 'I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord.' This testimony, accompanied by the Holy Ghost, illuminated Brigham Young's understanding and filled him with light, glory, and immortality, confirming the truth of the testimony. This experience highlights the power of sincere, heartfelt testimony in missionary work today. Missionaries are encouraged to bear testimony often, as it helps create an environment for investigators to feel the Holy Ghost confirming the truth, preparing them to accept commitments and build faith in Jesus Christ."
"How does D&C 88:118 guide missionaries in using study journals for personal growth and effective teaching, and what role does virtue play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\n## Virtue (Page 132) Virtue originates in your innermost thoughts and desires. It is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral standards. Since the Holy Ghost does not dwell in unclean tabernacles, virtue is prerequisite to receiving the Spirit’s guidance. What you choose to think and do when you are alone and you believe no one is watching is a strong measure of your virtue. Virtuous people are clean and pure spiritually. They focus on righteous, uplifting thoughts and put unworthy thoughts that lead to inappropriate actions out of their minds. They obey God’s commandments and follow the counsel of Church leaders. They pray for the strength to resist temptation and do what is right. They quickly repent of any sins or wrongdoings. They live worthy of a temple recommend. Your mind is like a stage in a theater; in the theater of your mind, however, only one actor can be on stage at a time. If the stage is left bare, thoughts of darkness and sin often enter the stage to tempt. But these thoughts have no power if the stage of your mind is occupied by wholesome thoughts, such as a memorized hymn or verse of scripture that you can call upon in a moment of temptation. By controlling the stage of your mind, you can successfully resist persistent urges to yield to temptation and indulge in sin. You can become pure and virtuous. #### Scripture Study (Page 133) - What does it mean to be virtuous? - D&C 4:6, D&C 25:2, D&C 38:24 - D&C 46:33, D&C 121:45–46, Articles of Faith 1:13 - 2 Peter 1:3–8, Topical Guide, “Virtue” ## Knowledge (Page 133) The Lord commanded, “Seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&C 88:118). He also warned, “It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance” (D&C 131:6). Seek knowledge, especially spiritual knowledge. Study the scriptures every day, and also study the words of the living prophets. Through study and prayer, seek help for your specific questions, challenges, and opportunities. Give special attention to scripture passages you can use as you teach and as you answer questions about the restored gospel. Think about how you can apply gospel principles in your life. As you study diligently, prayerfully, and with pure intent, the Holy Ghost will enlighten your mind, teach you, and help you understand the meaning of the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets. You can also gain knowledge by watching and listening to others, especially Church leaders. Like Nephi, you can say: “My soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them. . . . Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard” (2 Nephi 4:15–16). #### Scripture Study (Page 133) - How does knowledge assist in doing the Lord’s work? - Alma 17:2–3, D&C 88:77–80 - How can you obtain knowledge? - 2 Nephi 32:1–5, Moroni 10:5, D&C 42:61, D&C 76:5–10, D&C 88:118 - Bible Dictionary, “Knowledge” Topical Guide, “Knowledge” ##', '<2-hop>\n\n#### Scripture Study (Page 33) What do the scriptures teach about learning the gospel?

This guidance is crucial for missionaries as it encourages them to use study journals to document their spiritual insights and gospel applications, thereby enhancing personal growth and teaching effectiveness. The process of seeking knowledge is intertwined with maintaining virtue, as virtuous individuals are described as those who focus on righteous thoughts and actions, which aligns with the guidance of the Holy Ghost. By controlling their thoughts and maintaining virtue, missionaries can better resist temptation and remain spiritually clean, which is essential for receiving divine guidance and effectively teaching the gospel. Thus, D&C 88:118 not only encourages the pursuit of knowledge but also underscores the necessity of virtue in this pursuit, ensuring that missionaries are spiritually prepared to fulfill their roles."
"How does D&C 8:10 relate to the importance of prayer in missionary work, and how can missionaries adjust their teaching to meet the needs of investigators as suggested in D&C 100:6?","['<1-hop>\n\nPray with Faith (Page 107) You can teach in the Lord’s way only by the power of the Spirit, and you receive the Spirit through the prayer of faith. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (D&C 42:14). As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” (2 Nephi 33:1). President Gordon B. Hinckley illustrated this principle by relating an experience from his mission: “I always remember two young men who served in my mission. One was a superstar. He was educated. He was bright. He was quick. He was a little arrogant. We had another who was a sign painter. He came from a sign shop with very little education, but he knew his inadequacies and he relied on the Lord. When he prayed, you knew he was talking with the Lord. It wasn’t a rote thing, it was a conversation and that young man accomplished wonders while the other young man went through the motions. The power that was in the one and the absence of power in the other was so apparent. Call upon the Lord. He has extended the invitation, and He will answer” (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 469). Strive to pray sincerely, with real intent, and with “all the energy of heart” (Moroni 7:48). Effective prayer requires great effort (see Moroni 10:3–4; D&C 8:10; 9:7). Give serious thought to your attitude and to the words you use. Consider the following when you pray: - Use the language of prayer, which shows that you love and respect your Heavenly Father. Use proper and respectful language in whatever language you speak. For example, in English use scriptural pronouns such as Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine. - Always express gratitude for your blessings. A conscious effort to be grateful will help you recognize how merciful the Lord has been in your life. - Pray specifically for the guidance and help of the Holy Ghost. Show that you value this blessing by being sensitive to and aware of spiritual promptings. Then courageously follow those promptings. - Pray with love and charity. Pray for people by name. Ask for inspiration to help you understand and meet their needs. Pray for the welfare of contacts, investigators, new converts, and less-active members. Pray for the members and priesthood and auxiliary leaders in your area. Pray for your family at home. Pray for your companion, other missionaries, and your mission president. Pray to know how you can help others, and then be willing to sacrifice in their behalf. - Pray that you will be shown where to go and what to do. Pray that you will be led to those who are prepared to receive the message of the Restoration. Pray that you will recognize them. - Recognize that your Heavenly Father knows what you need better than you do. Rely on the Spirit to know what to pray for (see 3 Nephi 19:24; D&C 46:28, 30). - In your prayers at night, give the Lord an accounting of your day’s activities. Then review with Him your plan for the next day. Listen for the promptings of the Spirit. - Pray to overcome temptation. Yielding to temptation interferes with the Spirit. - Pray and, when appropriate, fast for special blessings. - Pray about and ponder the scriptures. The scriptures open the window to revelation. - Believe that God will answer your prayers. Recognize that God’s thoughts are not your thoughts (see Isaiah 55:8–9), and trust God to answer your prayers in His own way and in His own time. “Every morning . . . , missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will be teaching. If they will do this, a new light will come into their lives. There will be greater enthusiasm for the work. They will come to know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking in His behalf. They will find a different response from those they teach. As they do so by the Spirit, their investigators will respond under the influence of the same Spirit.” – PRESIDENT GORDON B. HINCKLEY “MISSIONARY SERVICE,” FIRST WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP TRAINING MEETING, 11 JAN. 2003, 20', '<2-hop>\n\nActivity: Companion Study (Page 191) With your companion, practice different ways to begin a lesson using several of these suggestions. ## Adjust Your Teaching to Meet Needs (Page 191) Each person or family you teach is unique. Even though you will not understand all of their interests, achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to their circumstances. Regardless of needs or problems, all people are best helped as they accept and live the gospel. You will be able to adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the Spirit. You may alter the order of the lessons as you are inspired to adapt to the investigators’ interests and needs. You may use more than one meeting to teach the principles in one lesson, and occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons in a single meeting. Heavenly Father knows His children, so rely on inspiration to make these decisions as you teach. Pray for the gift of discernment, and pay attention to thoughts that come to your mind or feelings you have about what to teach. You will need to adjust your teaching to give more attention to those commitments that are more difficult for an investigator to keep. For example, one person may easily accept the Book of Mormon as the word of God, while another may struggle to accept anything but the Bible. One person may have trouble giving up tobacco but will readily accept the law of tithing. As you plan when to teach certain doctrines, be sensitive about how much new information you share. Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the investigators. Some will progress faster or slower than others. Make sure that you ask enough questions and listen carefully to their answers so you have a firm understanding of how quickly and how well the investigator is learning and applying the doctrines you are presenting. Be sensitive to time. Most teaching appointments should not last beyond 45 minutes. A teaching visit can be completed, however, in 15 or 20 minutes if needed. If the person has only 15 minutes to meet with you, adjust your teaching to respect that limitation. Trust in the promise that the Spirit will give you “in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say” (D&C 100:6). #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 192) Imagine that you are walking down the street and notice an older man struggling to place some heavy bags into a garbage can. You and your companion help him, and as a result he asks who you are. After some discussion he invites you into his home and agrees to hear your message. During the initial conversation he tells you that: - His wife died a year ago, and he really misses her. - He tires easily because of a heart condition. - He wonders more now than ever before whether God exists. What might you teach him? How could you adjust your teaching to best meet his needs and concerns?']","D&C 8:10 emphasizes the importance of praying with faith, which is crucial for missionaries to teach effectively by the power of the Spirit. This principle is highlighted in the context where missionaries are encouraged to pray sincerely and with real intent to receive the guidance of the Holy Ghost, which will help carry their teachings to the hearts of those they teach. On the other hand, D&C 100:6 suggests that missionaries should rely on the Spirit to know what to say in the very moment, which is essential for adjusting their teaching to meet the unique needs of each investigator. This involves being sensitive to the investigators' circumstances and adapting lessons to their interests and needs, ensuring that the teaching pace is appropriate and that the missionaries are responsive to the investigators' progress and challenges."

The Book of Mormon is evidence of this. You can hold it in your hands. You can read it, ponder how the message in the book can improve your life, and pray to know that the message is the word of God. - God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father - The Gospel Blesses Families - Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation - The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement - The Great Apostasy - The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith - The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ -Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ### Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 55) Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel, established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrines and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church. Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. **Commitments:** - Will you read and pray to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God? - Will you pray to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.', '<2-hop>\n\nKey Definitions (Page 72) Following are terms that are frequently not understood. Make sure you explain them clearly and find out if those you are teaching understand. - **Atonement:** As used in the scriptures, to atone is to suffer the penalty for an act of sin, thereby removing the effects of sin from the repentant sinners and allowing them to be reconciled to God. Jesus Christ suffered in Gethsemane and on the cross. He was the only one capable of making a perfect Atonement for all mankind. He suffered the penalty for our sins in Gethsemane and died on the cross. He took upon Himself the pains, sicknesses, temptations, afflictions, and infirmities of us all (see Alma 7:11–12). - **Exaltation:** Eternal life in God’s presence; to become like our Father in Heaven and live in His presence. The greatest of all the gifts of God. Exaltation comes through the Atonement of Christ and through obedience to all the laws and ordinances of the gospel. - **Fall (of Adam and Eve):** When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, they became mortal—that is, subject to sin and death. Adam became the “first flesh” upon the earth (Moses 3:7). Latter-day revelation makes clear that the Fall is a blessing and that Adam and Eve should be honored as the first parents of all mankind. - **Judgment:** God, through Jesus Christ, will judge us individually to determine the eternal glory we will receive. This judgment will be based on our obedience to God’s commandments, including our acceptance of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. We will receive our eternal reward based on whether our works and desires have been good or evil. - **Immortality:** The condition of living forever in a resurrected state, not subject to physical death. - **Mortality:** The time from birth until physical death. - **Physical death:** Separation of our spirit, which lives forever and cannot die, from our physical body. - **Premortal life (premortality; pre-earth life):** As spirit children of our Father in Heaven, we lived in His presence before we were born on this earth. In premortal life we did not have physical bodies. - **Redemption:** To deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment. Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin. Jesus’ Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death. Through His Atonement, those who have faith in Him and repent are also redeemed from spiritual death. - **Resurrection:** The reuniting of the spirit body with the physical body of flesh and bones after death. After resurrection, the spirit and body will never again be separated, and the person is immortal. Every person born on earth will be resurrected because Jesus Christ overcame death. - **Salvation:** To be saved from physical and spiritual death. All people will be saved from physical death by the grace of God, through the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Each individual can also be saved from spiritual death as well as by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ. This faith is manifested in a life of obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel and service to Christ. - **Spiritual death:** Separation from God and His influences; to die as to things pertaining to righteousness. Spiritual death was introduced into the world by the fall of Adam (see Alma 42:6–7). Mortals with evil thoughts, words, and works are spiritually dead while still alive on earth (see 2 Nephi 9:39). Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and by obedience to the principles and ordinances of the gospel, men and women can become clean from sin and overcome spiritual death. ###']","The concept of the Fall of Adam and Eve, as described in Moses 3:7, is integral to understanding the need for the restoration of the gospel. According to the teachings, the Fall introduced mortality and spiritual death into the world, making it necessary for God to reveal His gospel to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. This pattern of revelation is part of God's love and concern for His children, allowing them to know how to return to Him. The restoration of the gospel through prophets, including the modern-day prophet Joseph Smith, is seen as a continuation of this divine pattern, providing evidence of God's ongoing communication with His children and the fulfillment of His plan for their exaltation and redemption through the Atonement of Jesus Christ."
How does 1 Corinthians 2:11–14 relate to the importance of spiritual insights in missionary work and the role of temples in providing spiritual power?,"['<1-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 107) **What do these scriptures teach about the power of the Spirit in your work?** - 2 Nephi 33:1–2, D&C 42:11–17, D&C 50:13–22, Acts 2:37–38 - 1 Corinthians 2:11–14 Bible Dictionary, “Conversion” **What can you do to enjoy the power of the Spirit in your work?** - Alma 32:27–28, D&C 42:14, John 7:17 **Why is it important to teach what you know and believe?** - Alma 5:43–47, D&C 52:9, D&C 80:4 ##', '<2-hop>\n\nTemples and Family History (Page 100) God has commanded His people to build temples. In the temple we make sacred covenants and are endowed with, or are given, a gift of power and knowledge from on high. This power helps us in our daily lives and enables us to build God’s kingdom. In the temple we can also be married for time and eternity, thus making it possible for families to be together forever in God’s presence. After at least one year of membership, worthy adults may be eligible to receive from their bishop a recommend to receive their own endowment. After receiving their endowments, married couples may be sealed or married for eternity. The Savior loves all people and desires their salvation. Yet millions of people have died without having any opportunity to hear the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ or receive saving ordinances. Through His loving grace and mercy the Lord makes salvation possible for everyone who did not have the opportunity to receive, understand, and obey the gospel during their mortal lives. The gospel is preached to these deceased people in the spirit world. Members of the Church on earth perform the saving ordinances in behalf of their deceased ancestors and others. Deceased persons living in the spirit world have the opportunity to accept or reject the gospel and the ordinances performed in their behalf. For this reason, Church members search for information about their ancestors. They complete pedigree charts and family group records and submit the names of deceased relatives who need to have saving ordinances performed on their behalf in sacred temples. This is family history work. Worthy members ages 12 and over, including new members, may receive from their bishop a recommend to perform baptisms for the dead. #### Family History (Page 100) Invite new members to meet with a member or go to a local family history center (where available) for an introduction to family history work and to the resources available to them. Provide them with a copy of family history materials. #### Scripture Study (Page 100) - D&C 43:16, D&C 128, D&C 138, 1 Peter 3:18-21 - D&C 95:8-9, D&C 131, Psalm 65:4, 1 Corinthians 15:29 - D&C 124:22-42, D&C 132, Brochure, Welcome to the Family History Center #### Commitments (Page 100) - Will you prepare to receive temple ordinances? (Soon after baptism and confirmation, worthy members over age 12 can receive a recommend to go to the temple and participate in baptisms for the dead.) - Will you participate in family history work and submit the names of ancestors to receive proxy temple ordinances? ### Service (Page 101) One of the great blessings of membership in the Church is the opportunity to serve. When we give loving service to others, we are serving God. When we are baptized, we covenant to give such service (see Mosiah 18:8–10). We are to become aware of others’ physical and spiritual needs. We then give of our time, talents, and means to help meet those needs. We follow the example of the Savior, who came to serve others. We are to do what Jesus did and become like Him. Soon after baptism new members receive from priesthood leaders the blessing of a responsibility to help in the Church. This is referred to as a calling. All of the work in the Church is voluntary. No one is paid for such service. When we accept callings, we are sustained publicly in a Church meeting so that other members can acknowledge our calling and provide support. We are also set apart by a priesthood leader and given special blessings to help us fulfill our callings. The Church needs the talents and abilities of every member to fill a wide variety of callings. All callings are important and help build God’s kingdom. We are to accept such callings and work diligently to learn and fulfill our duties. As we do so, we grow in faith, develop new talents and a greater ability to serve, and receive numerous other blessings. Priesthood holders may be called as home teachers. Home teachers make at least monthly visits to the homes of assigned member families. They teach the gospel, support parents, nurture friendships, and help families prepare to receive and keep temple covenants. Visiting teachers represent the Relief Society by making monthly visits to each adult sister as assigned. #### Scripture Study (Page 101) **Charity:** - Moroni 7:43-48, D&C 88:125, Matthew 22:36-40, 1 Corinthians 13:1-8 **Care for the Poor:** - Mosiah 4:26, Alma 34:28-29, D&C 52:40, Matthew 25:40 **We Are to Serve:** - Mosiah 2:17, Mosiah 18:8-10, D&C 42:29, D&C 107:99-100 #### Commitments (Page 101) - Will you accept and fulfill the duties of a calling (including an assignment as a home teacher or visiting teacher)? - Will you support others in their callings? ###']","1 Corinthians 2:11–14 emphasizes the importance of understanding spiritual truths through the Spirit, which is crucial for missionaries as they seek to teach and convert others. This scripture highlights that spiritual insights are not discerned by human wisdom but through the Spirit of God. In the context of missionary work, this underscores the need for missionaries to rely on the Spirit to effectively communicate and teach the gospel. Additionally, the role of temples, as described in the context, is to endow individuals with spiritual power and knowledge from on high, which further supports missionaries in their work by providing them with divine assistance and strength. The combination of personal spiritual insights and the empowerment received from temple ordinances enables missionaries to fulfill their roles more effectively, aligning with the teachings of 1 Corinthians 2:11–14."

As you read and ponder your chosen passage, identify two or three ways you can apply it in your life. - 2 Nephi 31 - Alma 32:26–43 - Moroni 7:32–48 Evaluate how well you live the principles that you teach. Choose one way in which you can improve, and make plans to do so. ### Search, Ponder, and Remember (Page 36) - Be alert. Exercise, shower, and pray before you study. - Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), organize your study materials, and remain alert. - Pray and ask for understanding. - Study by topic. - Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me?” - Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king. - Study the words of the living prophets (in the approved missionary library and Church magazines). - Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter- day prophets, and other study resources to find answers. - A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse. - Share what you learn with other missionaries. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person. - Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying. - Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles you teach. ### Use Study Resources (Page 37) - Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, Index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps). - Use the missionary lessons, the approved missionary library, Church magazines, and this manual. - Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter. - Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded.

Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.” By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for eternal life. Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:20). #### Scripture Study (Page 80) - Endure to the End: 2 Nephi 9:24, 2 Nephi 31:14–20, 3 Nephi 27:16–17, Matthew 10:22 - Blessings for Those Who Endure: 1 Nephi 13:37, 3 Nephi 15:9, D&C 14:7 #### Invitation to Be Baptized (Page 81) The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?

We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes.

This approach encourages self-reflection and goal-setting for personal change. Additionally, 1 Nephi 13:37 emphasizes the blessings for those who endure to the end, which can inspire missionaries to remain steadfast in their commitments, such as faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and following the gospel path.

How can missionaries effectively use the Gospel Library to develop Christlike attributes and enhance their teaching and planning sessions?,"['<1-hop>\n\n# Missionary Conduct > 3.0 ## Introduction This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5). > 3.1 ## Christlike Behavior Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19). - Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these: - Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time? - Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation? - Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone? - What is appropriate for this culture? You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded. For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library. > 3.2 ## Temple Worthiness The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants. > 3.2.1 ### Temple Covenants Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior. Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires. > 3.2.2 ### Temple Worship If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day. For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.” > 3.3 ## The Law of Chastity One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas. You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information. The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them. If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately. > 3.4 ##', '<2-hop>\n\n| |9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing, unless you have a teaching appointment; if so, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | *Your daily activities should focus on interacting with people. Spread your planning and study activities throughout the day to avoid spending long periods of time in your apartment. If distance and time permit, you may leave and return to your apartment throughout the day to meet these needs. The schedule approved for your mission will allow time to work, rest, and refocus. It is important to get adequate rest and nutrition for your spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. > 2.4.3 ### Goal Setting and Planning Sessions Hold daily and weekly planning sessions with your companion. Consider the needs of those you are teaching and how to work with members as you review progress, set goals, and make plans for the day and for the week (see “How to Set Goals,” “The Weekly Planning Session,” and “Daily Planning Session” in “How Do I Use Time Wisely?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 8). > 2.4.4 ### Study Sessions Use your personal and companion study time to focus on the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets (found in Gospel Library), and these standards. These approved resources can strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach. If you have been assigned to learn a new language, study and practice it daily. If you are a new missionary, study with your trainer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes each day for the first 12 weeks in the mission field (see “For New Missionaries: Additional Companion Study” in “Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel?” in Preach My Gospel). > 2.4.5 ### Meals with Others If applicable, your mission president and the local stake president will provide guidelines for scheduling meals with people in your mission. When members or others provide meals: - Be respectful of their personal situations and time. - Be grateful for the food they offer. - Ask to teach a 15- or 20-minute lesson before or after the meal to strengthen those you visit and to provide you with an opportunity to improve your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Another adult of your own gender should be present with you and your companion when you eat a meal with someone of the opposite gender. > 2.5 ## Preparation Day Your mission president will assign one day each week as a preparation day. Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6). Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124). > 2.5.1 ### Preparation Day Activities Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following: - Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9) - Doing laundry - Getting haircuts and other personal grooming - Cleaning - Shopping - Resting - Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6) > 2.5.2 ### Sample Preparation Day Schedule A preparation day schedule might look something like the following: | Time | Event | | ----- | -----| | 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day. | 6:30–8:00 a.m. | - Pray. - Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day. - Plan (30 minutes). - Have personal study (30 minutes). | | 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. | - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1). - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. | | 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. | | 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing. If you have a teaching appointment, return by 9:30 p.m. | | 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. | | 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. | > 2.6 ##']","Missionaries can effectively use the Gospel Library to develop Christlike attributes by studying the scriptures and teachings of living prophets, which are available in the Gospel Library. This study can help them cultivate qualities such as gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience, as outlined in the missionary standards of behavior. Additionally, the Gospel Library provides resources like 'Preach My Gospel' that can be used during personal and companion study sessions to strengthen their knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. These resources also aid in planning sessions, where missionaries can set goals and make plans for their daily and weekly activities, ensuring they are prepared to meet the needs of those they teach.

How do the laws and ordinances taught after baptism and confirmation help Latter-day Saints maintain a relationship with their Father in Heaven?,"['<1-hop>\n\n## Obey and Honor the Law (Page 94) Latter-day Saints everywhere believe in obeying the laws of the country in which they live. Members of the Church are counseled to be good citizens, to participate in civil government and the political process, and to render community service. They do so, however, as concerned citizens, not as representatives of the Church. #### Scripture Study (Page 94) - D&C 58:21, D&C 130:20-21, Articles of Faith 1:12, D&C 98:5, D&C 134 #### Commitment (Page 95) - Will you obey the laws of the country in which you reside? **Baptismal Interview Questions That Apply** - Have you ever committed a serious crime? If so, are you now on probation or parole?

Record in your study journal the promises that have been realized in your life. ## Lesson 5: Laws and Ordinances After Baptism and Confirmation (Page 96) ### Prepare to Teach After converts are baptized and confirmed, ward leaders determine whether ward missionaries or full-time missionaries lead out in teaching and how long the full-time missionaries are involved. This lesson should be taught to new members soon after they are baptized and confirmed. You may begin teaching them about these laws and ordinances between their baptism and confirmation or even before baptism. Baptismal candidates should at least be aware of these laws and ordinances before baptism. This lesson works much like lesson 4. The approach you take should be determined by the needs of the recent converts and direction from the Spirit. Constantly think and pray about how to help recent converts live the gospel. Ideas include: - Teaching the new member each of the laws and ordinances from this lesson while reviewing “The Message of the Restoration,” “The Plan of Salvation,” and “The Gospel of Jesus Christ” lessons. For example, while reviewing the message of the Restoration you may want to teach about priesthood and missionary work; while reviewing the plan of salvation you may teach about eternal marriage, temples and family history work, and teaching and learning in the Church. When reviewing the gospel of Jesus Christ you may want to teach about the strait and narrow way and serving in the Church. - Teaching two or three of the laws and ordinances as a single lesson. - Teaching a single law or ordinance as a lesson. Work with members to help the new members accept and begin living these laws and ordinances. Help new members recognize that by keeping God’s laws, they will retain a remission of their sins and stay on the pathway to eternal life. They will experience greater peace and joy. They will find answers to life’s questions and security in the knowledge that they belong to the true Church of Jesus Christ. The laws and ordinances serve as directions for living joyfully, with faith in Jesus Christ and a firm hope of receiving eternal life with our Father in Heaven. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nLearn about the Commandments and Commitments (Page 86) As you study this lesson, follow the pattern below: - Study the section that describes the commandment and write a simple lesson plan with three to five main points. - Teach a two- or three-minute version to your companion. Practice how you will extend each commitment invitation and how you will resolve concerns. - Discuss ways to follow through on each commitment that investigators have accepted. ## Obedience (Page 86) God gives us commandments for our benefit. They are instructions from a loving Father in Heaven to help us have happy lives. He also gives us agency, or the ability and opportunity to choose between good and evil. When we obey God, we follow the influence of the Spirit and choose to conform to His will. Obedience to the commandments brings us peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. Obedience shows our love for God. Disobedience brings us sorrow. Heavenly Father knows our weaknesses and is patient with us. He blesses us as we strive to obey His commandments. He expects us to obey Him so He can bless us. #### Scripture Study (Page 86) - Agency: 2 Nephi 2:26-29, Alma 12:31, D&C 58:26-29, D&C 82:8-10, Topical Guide, “Agency” | - Obedience: D&C 130:20-21, John 14:15, 21, Ecclesiastes 12:13 **Commitment** - Will you obey the laws of God? ##']","The laws and ordinances taught after baptism and confirmation help Latter-day Saints maintain a relationship with their Father in Heaven by guiding them to live joyfully with faith in Jesus Christ and a firm hope of receiving eternal life.

How do the standards approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles guide missionaries in teaching the restored gospel with the Spirit?,"['<1-hop>\n\nObedience True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46). Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions. Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook. You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day. > 1.2 ## Standards for Life God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life. Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life. # Missionary Organization and Activities > 2.0 ## Introduction The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47). For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife. These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts. > 2.1 ##', '<2-hop>\n\nYou are called to teach the restored gospel to as many people as will receive you. Teaching is central to everything you do. You develop Christlike attributes, study the missionary lessons, improve your ability to speak in your mission language, and rely on the Spirit in order to teach with convincing power. The Lord stated this very simply as a commandment with a promise: “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (D&C 11:21). “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (D&C 84:85). The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the [missionary lessons] but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). Learn to rely on the Spirit to give you what you should say and do. By studying, developing, and using the teaching skills in this chapter, you will become a more capable instrument in the hands of the Lord. The Spirit will draw upon the knowledge and skills you have developed to help you teach more powerfully. The quality and power of your teaching will help others understand and feel the importance the restored gospel has for them. Their understanding will be influenced by your personal worthiness. Their understanding will also be influenced by how well you focus your attention on them, by how well you explain the gospel, use the scriptures, share your testimony, ask questions, and invite them to make and keep commitments. #### Follow the Spirit (Page 190) “The Spirit is the most important single element in this work. With the Spirit magnifying your call, you can do miracles for the Lord in the mission field. Without the Spirit, you will never succeed regardless of your talent and ability” (Ezra Taft Benson, seminar for new mission presidents, 25 June 1986). #### Invite the Spirit (Page 190) The following suggestions will help you invite the Spirit as you teach: - Pray. - Use the scriptures. - Bear testimony. - Share experiences. - Express love for the Lord and for others. ##']","The standards approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles guide missionaries by emphasizing obedience to commandments and missionary standards, which are essential for personal growth and effective teaching. These standards encourage missionaries to develop Christlike attributes, study the missionary lessons, and rely on the Spirit to teach with convincing power. The guidance includes not teaching by rote but speaking from the heart, using one's own words as prompted by the Spirit, and focusing on the needs of those being taught. This approach ensures that missionaries can teach the restored gospel in a way that allows the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught, thereby magnifying their call and enabling them to perform miracles in the mission field."
How does Gordon B. Hinckley's guidance on missionary work emphasize the importance of coordination between full-time missionaries and ward members?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMissionary Coordination (Page 233) Ward missionary work is normally coordinated in the priesthood executive committee and ward council meetings through use of the Progress Record, provided by the full-time missionaries. The missionary objective of these meetings is to report, plan, and coordinate assignments to find, teach, fellowship, and activate as outlined in the following paragraphs. - Finding People to Teach. The priesthood executive committee and ward council discuss plans for preparing specific people to be taught by the full-time missionaries. They discuss the progress of specific ward members in preparing individuals and families for the missionary lessons. - Teaching and Baptizing. The priesthood executive committee and ward council review the Progress Record each week, which describes the progress of each person being taught by the full-time missionaries. They also coordinate plans for teaching in members’ homes, fellowshipping investigators, and ensuring member participation at baptismal services. - Fellowshipping and Teaching New Members. The priesthood executive committee and ward council review the Convert Action List to monitor the progress of each new member. They also discuss how to fellowship new members. As requested by the bishop, they recommend potential callings for new converts. - Fellowshipping and Teaching Less-Active Members. The priesthood executive committee and ward council coordinate activation efforts of priesthood quorums and full-time missionaries. They also plan how to fellowship less-active members, especially by inviting them to Church meetings and activities. ### Additional Coordination with the Ward Mission Leader (Page 233) Missionary work in the ward is normally coordinated in priesthood executive committee and ward council meetings. If additional coordination is necessary, the ward mission leader may hold missionary coordination meetings with the full-time missionaries. Others who may be invited to attend this meeting include ward missionaries, an assistant from the high priests group leadership, a counselor from the elders quorum presidency, and a counselor from the Relief Society presidency. Those attending the meeting may review and report on assignments and goals from the previous meeting and discuss plans for the coming week. As needed, they may also coordinate the assignments of ward missionaries to work with full-time missionaries and discuss how to make the combined efforts of ward missionaries and full-time missionaries more effective. ### Ward Mission Plan (Page 234) Many wards have found that developing a ward mission plan promotes ward missionary work. Such a plan may include goals, initiatives, and activities to help ward members invite people to hear the gospel. Individuals and families also benefit from developing such a plan to guide their missionary efforts. Members should use every honorable means to find people who are willing to listen to the message of the Restoration. They should emphasize finding fathers, mothers, and children who will come into the Church as families. Following are some suggestions to consider in developing a mission plan. - Pray that the Lord will prepare the hearts of specific people to hear the gospel. Pray also to be sensitive to those whom He is preparing (see Alma 6:6). “It will be a great day,” taught President Gordon B. Hinckley, “when our people not only pray for the missionaries throughout the world, but ask the Lord to help them to assist the missionaries who are laboring in their own ward” (“Missionary Service,” First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, Jan. 2003, 19). - Be aware of opportunities to reach out to others. Be neighborly and reach out in love to all people. - Ask friends and neighbors to serve alongside members in such things as providing community service, providing meals to those in need, teaching miniclasses in Relief Society enrichment meetings, helping with ward activities, helping people move, working in Scouting, and helping with family history or welfare projects. - Invite nonmember relatives, friends, and neighbors to baptisms, confirmations, and priesthood ordinations. - Invite nonmembers to assist in special events, such as a breakfast on a national holiday. - Make ward meetings, activities, firesides, and open houses of such quality and interest that members feel eager to invite acquaintances to attend. - Invite people to family home evenings. - Visit people who are experiencing changes in their lives, such as marriages, births, or deaths. - Visit and help people who are moving into the neighborhood. Share information about the community, neighborhood, and the Church. - Take every opportunity to talk about the gospel. Discuss such topics as the Savior, the Book of Mormon, the Bible, the purpose of life, the family, and family history. - Encourage youth to befriend other youth and invite them to Church meetings and activities. - Work with part-member families. - Plan spiritually uplifting sacrament meetings. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 235) - With your companion, read and discuss pages 34–37 of True to the Faith, “Church Administration.” - Share with your companion and write in your study journal what you learned. - Discuss how your insights will influence the way you approach your work with Church leaders. ## The Commitment to Stay Active in the Church (Page 235) Missionary work has its greatest effect as people make and keep the commitment to stay active in the Church all the days of their lives. It is not enough for people to simply come into the Church. They must come to stay. All of your teaching and invitations must be directed toward this end. In order to receive all the blessings that our Heavenly Father has in store for them, members must continue to live the gospel and be active in the Church. Nephi taught: “And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; . . . ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ . . . and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:19–20). Give your best efforts to help people qualify for “eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (D&C 14:7). #### Remember This', '<2-hop>\n\nWork with the Ward Council to Strengthen New and Less-Active Members (Page 229) Teaching and baptizing investigators is under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity together. You may often be invited to attend ward council and priesthood executive committee meetings. Your first priority is to make sure that your investigators are at Church. Frequently this will mean that you will accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council or priesthood executive committee. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: *“Every new convert needs three things: “1. A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems. “2. An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. . . . “3. Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (Moro. 6:4). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism” (Ensign, May 1999, 106).* The ward council will take the lead in providing a friend, responsibility, and spiritual nourishment for new converts. You will help them as requested. Priesthood leaders and members will do the fellowshipping, with your assistance. ### Friendship (Page 230) - Before baptism and confirmation, ensure that members are present at every lesson, if possible. These members should be with the investigators often to answer their questions, understand their challenges, and encourage them. - Invite members to attend the baptismal service and to welcome new converts into the ward. Members help new converts feel comfortable in various Church meetings. They should also introduce them to other members. - Introduce the investigators to the bishop, his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and other ward leaders as soon as possible. Explain the roles of the bishop and other ward leaders. ### Opportunities to Serve (Page 230) • Help male converts understand and prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. Explain that priesthood quorums provide opportunities to learn, worship, and serve together. • Involve new converts and less-active members in service opportunities such as helping a widow or someone who is ill or participating in welfare projects. • Refer converts to family history consultants so they might complete a family group record and pedigree chart. If circumstances allow, help them prepare to be baptized in the temple for their deceased ancestors. • Invite converts to prepare family members and friends to be taught by the missionaries. The missionaries should ask new converts and less-active members for referrals. ### Nourishment by the Word of God (Page 230) - Finish teaching the principles in lesson 5, “Laws and Ordinances.” - Remind new converts and less-active members of commitments they made before baptism and the covenants they made when they were baptized and confirmed. - Encourage them to pray daily as individuals and with their families. - Encourage them to study the scriptures daily, especially the Book of Mormon. - Strengthen new converts’ testimonies of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Review the lessons that you taught before baptism and confirmation, adapting the commitment invitations to their current needs. - Continue to teach the importance of attending church each Sunday and worthily partaking of the sacrament. Attend and sit with new converts or less-active members. - Invite them to attend the Gospel Principles class during Sunday School. - Teach them how to hold family home evening on Monday nights using the Family Home Evening Resource Book. - Encourage them to share the restored gospel with others. - Help them enroll in seminary or institute classes. - Make them aware of Church resources such as www.mormon.org, www.lds.org, and www.familysearch.org. #### Scripture Study (Page 231) - Nourish with God’s - Mosiah 18:18-20, Alma 31:5, Moroni 6:4 - Service - Mosiah 2:17, Matthew 25:40, Topical Guide, “Serve” and “Service” ##']","Gordon B. Hinckley emphasized the importance of coordination between full-time missionaries and ward members by highlighting the need for new converts to have a friend in the Church, an assignment, and to be nourished by the word of God. He stated that every new convert needs a friend who can provide support and answer questions, an assignment to help them grow in faith and love for the Lord, and spiritual nourishment through participation in Church activities. This guidance underscores the collaborative efforts required between missionaries and ward members to ensure the successful integration and continued activity of new converts in the Church. The ward council plays a crucial role in providing these elements, with the assistance of full-time missionaries, to strengthen new and less-active members."
"How does the priesthood authority, as described in the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, play a role in strengthening new and less-active members through the ward council and missionary efforts?","['<1-hop>\n\nPriesthood and Auxiliaries (Page 97) Priesthood is the power and authority given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Through the priesthood we receive the ordinances of salvation, as well as blessings of healing, comfort, and counsel. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is led by Jesus Christ through apostles and prophets. These are righteous men who are called of God and given the priesthood. Anciently Christ ordained His Apostles and gave them the priesthood. That authority was lost when the people rejected the gospel and killed Christ and the Apostles. Priesthood authority was restored in 1829 when John the Baptist appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. He laid his hands on their heads and conferred on them the Aaronic Priesthood (see D&C 13). A short time later Peter, James, and John of the original Twelve Apostles laid their hands on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood, which Peter, James, and John had received from Jesus Christ (see D&C 27:12–13). A man can receive priesthood authority only by proper ordination by the laying on of hands by one who has the authority. A man who receives the priesthood is given a marvelous opportunity. He enters a covenant to fulfill sacred duties, serve others, and help build up the Church. He must have a desire to serve God and must be ordained to this power (see D&C 4:3; 63:57). It is also necessary for priesthood holders to perform sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation. When priesthood authority is used worthily, the power of God is manifest. Priesthood power can be used only in righteousness, love, and patience. All priesthood comes from God. There are two priesthoods in the Church: the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. The Aaronic Priesthood administers ordinances such as baptism and the sacrament. Worthy males ages 12 and over receive the Aaronic Priesthood soon after baptism and confirmation. Worthy adult males will eventually receive the Melchizedek, or higher, Priesthood. Members of the Church receive many spiritual and temporal blessings through the power of this priesthood. Worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders can confer the gift of the Holy Ghost, ordain others to the priesthood as assigned, anoint the sick with consecrated oil, and give blessings of healing and comfort. Worthy husbands and fathers who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood can give their spouses, children, and other family members special blessings. Home teachers visit the homes of Church members and care for those individuals and families. Bishops and stake presidents are judges in the Church. They have the authority to help Saints who have sinned to repent and enjoy the full blessings of Church membership. They interview people to ensure their worthiness to enter the temple. Under priesthood direction, auxiliary organizations assist in strengthening members. They are a great resource in missionary work as they assist in finding and teaching investigators and fellowshipping new converts. Women age 18 and older are members of the Relief Society, which reaches out in service to families, individuals, and the community. Young women ages 12 to 18 are members of the Young Women program. Boys of similar ages participate in the Young Men program. All children ages 3 to 11 are part of the Primary organization. All members age 12 and older are enrolled in Sunday School classes. #### Scripture Study (Page 98) - Mosiah 18:17, D&C 84:19-20, Luke 9:1-6 - Alma 13:1-19, D&C 107, John 15:16 - D&C 20:38-65, D&C 121:34-46, James 5:14-15 #### Commitments (Page 98) - Will you prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood (eligible and worthy males age 12 and over)? - Will you prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood (eligible and worthy adult males)? - Will you participate actively in the appropriate auxiliary organization? ###', '<2-hop>\n\nWork with the Ward Council to Strengthen New and Less-Active Members (Page 229) Teaching and baptizing investigators is under the direction of your mission president.

How does the concept of a gospel dispensation relate to the study of the Book of Moses in missionary work?,"['<1-hop>\n\nSee the Big Picture (Page 37) - Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background. - Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph. - Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain. - Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 37) Read the chapter summaries of the books below and write an outline that describes the setting, main events, and main doctrines of each book. - 1 Nephi - Moses - Acts ### Explore the Details (Page 38) - Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions. Examine surrounding words or phrases for clues to what the key words mean. - Look for connecting words, such as therefore, and again, thus, wherefore, and others. Then see how the preceding and following passages relate to each other. - Use the Topical Guide to see how the same word is used in other contexts or how other prophets use the same word. - Look for unfamiliar words or phrases and make sure you understand them. ### Marking Scriptures (Page 38) Marking your scriptures can assist you in thinking deeply about a passage or doctrine of the gospel. You can mark your scriptures in many ways. Find a method that works for you. Below are some guidelines for marking scriptures. - Use pencils or colored markers. Avoid using pens that bleed through the paper. - Shade, underline, bracket, or outline part of a verse, an entire verse, or a group of verses. - Avoid excessive marking. The benefit is lost if you cannot understand your markings because you have made too many notes, lines, and colors. - Underline only a few key words to highlight the verse, section, or chapter. - Circle or underline key words, and then use straight lines to link closely related words. - When a series of points in a verse or passage are related, number the points in the margin or text. - Use the footnotes as a resource for marking and interpreting the scriptures. - Place a symbol (such as a check mark) in the margin for key verses you feel are critical to remember. Marking your scriptures should help you focus on applying what you learn and on teaching others. Develop an approach that is consistent and helps you accomplish your purpose as a missionary. #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 38) Which suggestions have you not yet tried? Identify one suggestion from “Study Ideas and Suggestions” to try during your next personal or companion study session. #### Remember This (Page 38) - Pursuing the desire to learn is important to your salvation and your success as a missionary. - You learn the gospel by study, faith, and the power of the Holy Ghost. - Learning is a joy and brings many blessings. - Daily personal and companion study strengthens your faith and your ability to teach by the Spirit. - Use a variety of study methods that make the experience meaningful and enjoyable. ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 39) ### Personal Study (Page 39) 1. Rate yourself on the following (1=never, 3=some of the time, and 5=almost always). - I think about the people I am teaching when I study. - Throughout the day I think about what I studied in the morning. - As I study, ideas come to my mind that have not occurred to me before. - I record spiritual impressions and ideas in an appropriate place. - I fall asleep as I study. - I look forward to personal study. - I look forward to companion study. Review your responses. What are you doing well? Do you wish any of your responses were different? Set one or two goals that will improve the quality of your study. 2. Review the “Consider This” questions at the beginning of this chapter. How do these questions influence your study? 3. Review the “Study Ideas and Suggestions.” Identify one suggestion from each category that you have not used, and try these ideas during your personal study. 4. Read Doctrine and Covenants 138:1–11. As you read these verses, answer the following questions: – What did President Smith have to do for his mind to be opened? – How did he feel about the doctrine he was thinking about? 5. Read the definition of knowledge in the Bible Dictionary and the references listed. In your study journal, write an answer to the question “What knowledge can help me serve effectively as a missionary?” 6. Select a doctrine from chapter 3 you would like to understand better. Write in your study journal questions you would like to answer. Carefully study that doctrine for a period of time (a few days), and pray specifically for increased understanding. Write what you learn. 7. Read 1 Nephi 10:17; 11:1–6. As you read these verses, answer the question “Why was Nephi able to learn what his father knew?”', '<2-hop>\n\nKey Definitions (page 58) - **Agency:** The ability and privilege God gives people to choose and to act for themselves. - **Apostasy:** A turning away from the truth by individuals, the Church, or entire nations. It includes rebellion against authority and rejection of prophets. Evidence of apostasy includes transgressing God’s laws, changing gospel ordinances, and breaking covenants (see Isaiah 24:5). - **Dispensation:** A period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood. In addition to Jesus Christ, prophets such as Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Joseph Smith have each started a new gospel dispensation. When the Lord organizes a dispensation, the gospel is revealed anew so that the people of that dispensation do not have to depend on past dispensations for knowledge of the plan of salvation. The dispensation begun by Joseph Smith is known as the “dispensation of the fulness of times.” - **Priesthood:** The authority and power that God gives to man to act in the name of Jesus Christ in all things for the salvation of mankind. - **Prophet:** A man who has been called by and speaks for God. As a messenger of God, a prophet receives priesthood authority, commandments, prophecies, and revelations from God. His responsibility is to make known God’s will and true character to mankind and to show the meaning of His dealings with them. A prophet denounces sin and foretells its consequences. He is a preacher of righteousness. On occasion, a prophet may be inspired to foretell the future for the benefit of mankind. His primary responsibility, however, is to bear witness of Christ. - **Redeemer:** Jesus Christ is the great Redeemer of mankind because He, through His Atonement, paid the price for the sins of mankind and made possible the resurrection of all people. To redeem is to deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment. Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin. Jesus’ Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death. Through His Atonement, which includes His suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross as well as His Resurrection, those who have faith in Him and who repent are redeemed from spiritual death. - **Reformer:** To reform is to make changes to something in order to improve it. The term reformers refers to those men and women (such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, William Tyndale, and John Wycliffe) who protested the practices of the existing church, which they felt needed to be reformed. - **Restoration:** To restore means to return to a former condition, or to bring back. The Restoration, as used by Latter-day Saints, means that the true Church of Jesus Christ, which was lost through apostasy, was brought back as it originally existed when organized by Jesus Christ. Unlike the Reformation, the Restoration was accomplished by divine authority through revelation. - **Revelation:** Communication from God to His children on earth. Revelation may come through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost by way of inspiration, visions, dreams, or visits by angels. Revelation provides guidance that can lead the faithful to eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom. The Lord reveals His work to His prophets and confirms to believers that the revelations to the prophets are true (see Amos 3:7). Through revelation, the Lord provides individual guidance for every person who seeks it and who has faith, repents, and is obedient to the gospel of Jesus Christ. **']","The concept of a gospel dispensation, as defined in the context, refers to a period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood. Prophets such as Moses have each started a new gospel dispensation. In missionary work, studying the Book of Moses can provide insights into the doctrines and events of his dispensation, helping missionaries understand the context and background of the gospel as it was revealed anew during his time. This understanding can enhance personal growth and effective teaching by allowing missionaries to see the big picture and apply spiritual insights from Moses' dispensation to their own teaching and study practices."
How Alma 32:27–28 help in understanding the power of the Spirit in your work and what suggestions from the study plan can be applied to this understanding?,"['<1-hop>\n\nIdeas for Study and Application (Page 148) ### Personal Study (Page 148) - Review the suggestions in this chapter. Identify a suggestion you have not yet tried, and set a goal to try it for the next few days. - At your next district meeting, ask an experienced missionary with good language ability what he or she has done to learn the language. - Read and discuss the following statement by Elder Richard G. Scott: “Where . . . national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God, set them aside. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished” (“Removing Barriers to Happiness,” Ensign, May 1998, 87). Think about the ways that the culture in the area where you serve is different from your own. Make a list of the differences. Then cross out any that conflict with the teachings of the gospel. Consider each of those that remain, and think about how you can make these customs your own. - Build a study plan to prepare you to do one of the following things in your mission language: - Tell the Joseph Smith story. - Summarize 3 Nephi 11. - Summarize Alma 32. - Tell the story of Nephi and the brass plates (see 1 Nephi 3–5). - Explain dispensations. - Share a personal experience. - Make note cards for words you don’t know in one of the lessons.

This scripture can help individuals understand the power of the Spirit in their work by encouraging them to cultivate their faith and be open to spiritual growth. From the study plan, one suggestion that can be applied is to build a study plan to summarize Alma 32, which would deepen one's understanding of the scripture and its application in enjoying the power of the Spirit in their work. Additionally, reflecting on Elder Richard G. Scott's statement about aligning traditions with gospel teachings can help individuals integrate spiritual principles into their daily lives, enhancing their spiritual work."
How does President Gordon B. Hinckley's guidance on supporting new converts align with the teachings of the Book of Mormon in fostering spiritual growth and testimony development?,"['<1-hop>\n\nWork with the Ward Council to Strengthen New and Less-Active Members (Page 229) Teaching and baptizing investigators is under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity together. You may often be invited to attend ward council and priesthood executive committee meetings. Your first priority is to make sure that your investigators are at Church. Frequently this will mean that you will accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council or priesthood executive committee. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: *“Every new convert needs three things: “1. A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems. “2. An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. . . . “3. Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (Moro. 6:4). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism” (Ensign, May 1999, 106).* The ward council will take the lead in providing a friend, responsibility, and spiritual nourishment for new converts. You will help them as requested. Priesthood leaders and members will do the fellowshipping, with your assistance. ### Friendship (Page 230) - Before baptism and confirmation, ensure that members are present at every lesson, if possible. These members should be with the investigators often to answer their questions, understand their challenges, and encourage them. - Invite members to attend the baptismal service and to welcome new converts into the ward. Members help new converts feel comfortable in various Church meetings. They should also introduce them to other members. - Introduce the investigators to the bishop, his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and other ward leaders as soon as possible. Explain the roles of the bishop and other ward leaders. ### Opportunities to Serve (Page 230) • Help male converts understand and prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. Explain that priesthood quorums provide opportunities to learn, worship, and serve together. • Involve new converts and less-active members in service opportunities such as helping a widow or someone who is ill or participating in welfare projects. • Refer converts to family history consultants so they might complete a family group record and pedigree chart. If circumstances allow, help them prepare to be baptized in the temple for their deceased ancestors. • Invite converts to prepare family members and friends to be taught by the missionaries. The missionaries should ask new converts and less-active members for referrals. ### Nourishment by the Word of God (Page 230) - Finish teaching the principles in lesson 5, “Laws and Ordinances.” - Remind new converts and less-active members of commitments they made before baptism and the covenants they made when they were baptized and confirmed. - Encourage them to pray daily as individuals and with their families. - Encourage them to study the scriptures daily, especially the Book of Mormon. - Strengthen new converts’ testimonies of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Review the lessons that you taught before baptism and confirmation, adapting the commitment invitations to their current needs. - Continue to teach the importance of attending church each Sunday and worthily partaking of the sacrament. Attend and sit with new converts or less-active members. - Invite them to attend the Gospel Principles class during Sunday School. - Teach them how to hold family home evening on Monday nights using the Family Home Evening Resource Book. - Encourage them to share the restored gospel with others. - Help them enroll in seminary or institute classes. - Make them aware of Church resources such as www.mormon.org, www.lds.org, and www.familysearch.org. #### Scripture Study (Page 231) - Nourish with God’s - Mosiah 18:18-20, Alma 31:5, Moroni 6:4 - Service - Mosiah 2:17, Matthew 25:40, Topical Guide, “Serve” and “Service” ##', '<2-hop>\n\nThe Book of Mormon Draws People Nearer to God (Page 122) Regarding the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (introduction to the Book of Mormon). The Book of Mormon is a springboard to testimony and personal revelation. Use the Book of Mormon to help people have spiritual experiences, especially a witness from the Holy Ghost that the book itself is true. By consistently inviting people to live the principles found in the Book of Mormon, you help them develop faith in Jesus Christ and draw nearer to God. President Gordon B. Hinckley declared: “Those who have read [the Book of Mormon] prayerfully, be they rich or poor, learned or unlearned, have grown under its power. . . . Without reservation I promise you that if you will prayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts . . . the Spirit of the Lord. There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“The Power of the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, June 1988, 6). ## Use the Book of Mormon to Respond to Objections (Page 122) Many people will not believe everything you teach. President Ezra Taft Benson taught how the Book of Mormon can be the central resource in responding to such situations: “We are to use the Book of Mormon in handling objections to the Church. . . . “. . . All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. . . . The only problem the objector has to resolve forhimself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation. “Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively. We are not obligated to answer every objection. Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand” (A Witness and a Warning, 4–5). For example, sincere investigators might object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom. Help them see that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation. You might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.” Investigators must resolve for themselves their concerns and objections. You can help as you focus them on what will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. When they strengthen their testimony of the Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections and concerns. As you answer concerns, remember that our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his successors—who receive direct revelation from God. There- fore, the first question for an investigator to answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon.']","President Gordon B. Hinckley emphasized the importance of providing new converts with a friend, an assignment, and nourishment by the word of God to help them grow in faith and integrate into the Church community. This aligns with the teachings of the Book of Mormon, which is described as a powerful tool for drawing people nearer to God and strengthening their testimony. By encouraging new converts to study the Book of Mormon, they can have spiritual experiences and receive a witness from the Holy Ghost, as highlighted by both President Hinckley and the Prophet Joseph Smith. This process of engaging with the Book of Mormon helps converts develop faith in Jesus Christ and resolve any objections they may have, ultimately reinforcing their commitment to the gospel and the Church."
How can the teachings from 2 Nephi 29:8–10 and 2 Nephi 31:18–20 be applied to enhance missionary work and the retention of new converts within a ward?,"['<1-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 22) How should you use the Book of Mormon in your missionary work? - Read 1 Nephi 13:39 2 Nephi 29:8–10, Moroni 10:3–5 D&C 20:5–16, D&C 42:12–14 for answers to the question #### Activity: Personal Study (Page 22) Imagine that you are going to write an article about the message of the Restoration for a local newspaper. In your study journal write a title that describes the central message. Then record your thoughts and feelings about this message, including how understanding it better has changed the way you live and the way you view the world around you. ## Helping Others Make Commitments: The Door to Faith and Repentance (Page 22) Help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “The first thing you will do when an investigator tells you he or she had not read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! . . . Much of the time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the balance. . . . It is the most important path this investigator will ever walk. But if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! . . . So take control of this situation. Teach with power and authority, and then be devastated if the first steps toward commandment-keeping and covenant-keeping have not been successfully begun” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1997).', '<2-hop>\n\n### Bishop (Page 232) The bishop is responsible for missionary, retention, and activation efforts in the ward. His personal participation and leadership are essential. To help accomplish this work, the bishop calls a worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holder to serve as the ward mission leader. He also calls a sufficient number of ward missionaries to meet the needs in the ward. The bishop uses the priesthood executive committee and the ward council to coordinate missionary, retention, and activation efforts. He gives direction to developing and carrying out a ward mission plan. #### Activity: Companion Study (Page 232) Plan a time to meet with the bishop. Seek his guidance on how you can best serve in the ward. ### Priesthood and Auxiliary Leaders (Page 232) Priesthood and auxiliary leaders should regularly review the status of new members and less-active members and plan how to best fellowship and strengthen them. They should also work closely with the ward mission leader to coordinate missionary, retention, and activation efforts with ward missionaries and full-time missionaries. ### Ward Mission Leader (Page 232) Ward Mission Leader Under the direction of the bishop, the ward mission leader: - Sets an example in sharing the gospel with others and fellowshipping investigators, new converts, and less-active members. - Coordinates the work of the ward missionaries and full-time missionaries with priesthood leaders, auxiliary leaders, and members. - Uses the Progress Record, the Convert Action List, and the Bishopric Action and Interview List to review the progress of investigators, new converts, and less-active members in priesthood executive committee and ward council meetings. The Convert Action List and the Bishopric Action and Interview List are reports created using the ward meetinghouse computer. They are used to track the progress of new converts and other members. - Conducts weekly missionary coordination meetings. - Organizes convert baptismal services in the ward in cooperation with the full-time missionaries. A member of the bishopric or the ward mission leader usually conducts these services. The ward mission leader also serves on the ward priesthood executive committee, ward council, and ward welfare committee and attends stake priesthood leadership meetings. ### Ward Missionaries (Page 233) Qualified brothers and sisters are called to serve as ward missionaries. They are supervised by the ward mission leader. Ward missionaries find, fellowship, and teach investigators. They also instruct and fellowship new converts and less-active members. A ward missionary holding the Melchizedek Priesthood may be called to serve as an assistant ward mission leader. ### (Page 235) - Build strong relationships with the bishop and members of the ward council. - Participate in appropriate ways during priesthood executive committee and ward council meetings. - Be of service to the ward council. When members of the council ask for your help: - Be willing to fellowship converts and less-active members, assist them in their callings and service opportunities, and reteach the missionary lessons. - With members, teach new converts the lesson “Laws and Ordinances.” ## Ideas for Study and Application (Page 236) ### Personal Study (Page 236) - Using your daily planner, make plans to talk to new converts and recently activated members about changing their lives and attending church. What has helped them most? In your study journal, write your thoughts about their experiences. What have you learned that will help you in working with your current investigators? - Study 2 Nephi 31:18–20; Alma 26:1–7 and 32:32–43; and Moroni 6. Write what you learn from these verses about strengthening new converts.']","The teachings from 2 Nephi 29:8–10 emphasize the importance of the Book of Mormon in missionary work, encouraging missionaries to use it as a tool to teach true doctrine and invite individuals to make commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. This aligns with the guidance provided to missionaries to help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives. Meanwhile, 2 Nephi 31:18–20 provides insights into the perseverance required in the path of discipleship, which can be applied to strengthen new converts by encouraging them to continue in faith and commitment. Within a ward, these teachings can be applied by the bishop and ward mission leader to coordinate efforts in missionary work, retention, and activation, ensuring that new converts are supported in their journey of faith through regular fellowship and teaching, as outlined in the ward mission plan."
"How does 3 Nephi 11:31–41 contribute to understanding the doctrine of Christ, and how was it used by missionaries to inspire Brother Snider's decision to be baptized?","['<1-hop>\n\n“After several weeks of watching Brother Snider struggle, my companion and I felt impressed to again read 3 Nephi 11 with the Sniders. I will never forget what happened that night. As we opened the Book of Mormon, my companion explained, ‘This chapter, as you might recall, recounts the Savior’s visit to the people in the Book of Mormon. Here we read about the Savior’s love for these people and what He taught them.’ We each took turns reading a verse or two. After reading through verse 5, my companion interrupted and said, ‘I have always been impressed with the description given here of the voice they heard. The voice was not harsh, it was not loud, and although it was a small voice, it had a powerful piercing effect on them. This voice was not only heard with their ears, but it spoke to their hearts.’ I watched the Sniders as they listened intently to my companion. “After some discussion about prayer and listening to the Spirit, it was Brother Snider’s turn to read: ‘And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them: Behold my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.’ Brother Snider paused, looking intently at his Book of Mormon. Then he looked up at me and said, ‘Heavenly Father was really proud of His Son, wasn’t He?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. Brother Snider looked back at his book again and stared at the open pages as if deep in thought. Finally he said, ‘I would want Heavenly Father to be proud of me too. I wonder how He would introduce me. I guess, if I . . . well, if I want Him to be proud of me then I had better do what He wants me to do.’ ‘Yes, I think that would be important,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ Brother Snider continued. ‘I think I’ve been worrying too much about what everybody else thinks and not enough about what God thinks.’ After a brief pause Brother Snider nodded and with a determined look said, ‘I think I had better be baptized.’ His response was so unexpected that my companion and I looked at him with blank stares. Finally, my companion said, ‘Yes, that would be the right thing to do. In fact, later on in this chapter the Savior teaches . . .’ As my companion talked I felt a burning in my heart and gratitude for the power of the Book of Mormon.” How did these missionaries use the Book of Mormon? How will you and your companion use it more effectively in your missionary efforts? ### District Meetings and Zone Conferences (Page 127) - Practice using the Book of Mormon in each of the ways mentioned in the main headings of this chapter. - List objections or questions raised by investigators.

In the context provided, missionaries used this chapter from the Book of Mormon to help Brother Snider understand the Savior's love and teachings. As they read and discussed the chapter, Brother Snider was moved by the description of the voice of the Lord and the message of divine approval. This led him to reflect on his own life and desire to have Heavenly Father be proud of him, ultimately inspiring his decision to be baptized. The missionaries effectively used the Book of Mormon to convey the message of the Restoration and facilitate Brother Snider's spiritual journey."
How does the teaching of John 3:16–17 relate to the concept of eternal life and the plan of salvation as outlined in the missionary lesson plans?,"['<1-hop>\n\nMedium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes) (Page 81) Our message is one of faith and hope. We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have eternal life in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life. The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord. Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost. **Commitments** - Will you continue to develop faith in Jesus Christ by continuing to learn about His gospel? - Will you repent and pray for forgiveness of sins? - Will you be baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on (date)?

It maps our eternal journey through premortality, mortal life, death, resurrection, and to our life in the eternities. The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him. The plan focuses on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ in overcoming the effects of the Fall and making eternal life possible for us. We invite you to ponder and pray about this message. - Pre-Earth Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us - The Creation - Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve - Our Life on Earth - The Atonement - The Spirit World - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality - Kingdoms of Glory **Commitments:** - Will you pray to know that what we have taught is true? - Will you repent of your sins? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ###']","The teaching of John 3:16–17, which emphasizes that God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, into the world, is central to the missionary lesson plans as it underscores the belief that only through Christ's grace and mercy can individuals be cleansed from sin and attain eternal life. This scripture is integrated into the lesson plans to highlight the necessity of accepting Christ, repenting, and obeying His teachings to receive blessings. The plan of salvation, as outlined in the lessons, maps the eternal journey of individuals, explaining the purpose of life on earth and the path to eternal life, which is made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

It maps our eternal journey through premortality, mortal life, death, resurrection, and to our life in the eternities. The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him.

We invite you to ponder and pray about this message. - Pre-Earth Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us - The Creation - Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve - Our Life on Earth - The Atonement - The Spirit World - The Resurrection, Judgment, and Immortality - Kingdoms of Glory **Commitments:** - Will you pray to know that what we have taught is true? - Will you repent of your sins? - Will you attend church with us this Sunday? - Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)? - May we set a time for our next visit? - Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include. ###']","3 Nephi 11 is significant in the context of the plan of salvation as it details the visit of Jesus Christ to the Americas, where He teaches the principles of His gospel, including baptism, which is a crucial ordinance for entering the celestial kingdom. This aligns with the plan of salvation's focus on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ, which makes eternal life possible. 3 Nephi 28:10, on the other hand, relates to the kingdoms of glory by describing the promise of eternal life and the celestial kingdom, which is compared to the glory of the sun. This scripture emphasizes the ultimate goal of the plan of salvation, which is to return to the presence of God and become like Him, as outlined in the teachings about the celestial kingdom. Together, these scriptures provide a comprehensive understanding of the journey through life, the importance of sacred ordinances, and the eternal destinations available to individuals based on their choices and acceptance of the gospel."

Obedience is the first law of heaven. It is an act of faith. You may sometimes be required to do things you do not completely understand. As you obey, you increase in faith, knowledge, wisdom, testimony, protection, and freedom. Strive to be obedient to the Lord, the living prophet, and your mission president. “The discipline contained in daily obedience and clean living and wholesome lives builds an armor around you of protection and safety from the temptations that beset you as you proceed through mortality.” – ELDER L.

Follow the pattern found above to understand better and to plan for developing the attribute. Look at the image of the name tag. How does your name tag differ from that worn by an employee of a company? Note that the two most prominent parts are your name and the Savior’s name. How can you ensure that you represent the Savior as one of His disciples? Why is it important for people to associate your name with the Savior’s in a positive way?

Did I exist before I was born? Will I live after I die? What is the purpose of life? Is Jesus really the Savior? Other questions may focus on more temporal needs: How can I improve my relationship with my spouse? How can I help my teenagers avoid drugs or immorality? How can I find work to support my family? The gospel of Jesus Christ helps us answer both kinds of questions. As we gain faith that the Book of Mormon is true, we can begin to answer questions about the purpose of life and the hope of eternal life. The Book of Mormon describes the plan of happiness, which gives meaning and perspective to life. Answers to questions such as the following are clearly taught in the Book of Mormon. - Is there a God? (Alma 22) - What does Jesus Christ expect of me? (2 Nephi 9) - How can a belief in Jesus Christ help me? (Alma 36) - Is there life after death? (Alma 40) - What is the purpose of life? (Alma 34) - Why does God allow evil and suffering to occur? (2 Nephi 2; Alma 14:9–11; 60:13) - Does my infant need to be baptized? (Moroni 8) - Does God know me? (Alma 5:38, 58) - Does God answer prayers? (Enos 1) - How can I find peace and joy? (Mosiah 2, 4) - How can my family be happier and more united? (Mosiah 2) - How can I balance my family and career? (3 Nephi 13) - How can I strengthen my relationship with my spouse? (3 Nephi 14) - How can I avoid the evils that threaten my family? (Alma 39) - How can I avoid sin? (Helaman 5) As we read the Book of Mormon with the guidance of the Spirit, it helps us answer personal questions. It teaches that prayer and revelation are the key to solving particular problems. It helps us have faith that God will answer our prayers. The Book of Mormon also helps us understand that God’s commandments are not a restrictive list of dos and don’ts but guideposts to a happy, abundant life. As we begin to understand that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are the way to the abundant life, we will appreciate that these principles help answer any question and fill any need. For example, we understand that repentance, forgiveness, and the covenant to serve others are essential in improving relationships with our spouses. We see that faith in Christ, accepting and keeping covenants, and following the promptings of the Spirit can help teenagers avoid the powerful temptations that surround them. The gospel can resolve almost any question or need. This is why you are to “teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel” (D&C 42:12). “In a world ever more dangerous . . . the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ has the nourishing power to heal starving spirits of the world. – PRESIDENT BOYD K.

Find verses in the Book of Mormon to answer these questions. Write the answers in your study journal, and use them as you teach. ##']","Ezra Taft Benson emphasized the importance of work in missionary efforts, stating that 'there is no satisfactory substitute, especially in missionary work.' This underscores the need for diligence and obedience, which are crucial attributes for missionaries as they strive to keep commandments and follow mission rules. Additionally, Benson highlighted the role of the Book of Mormon in answering the 'great questions of the soul,' such as the existence of God, the purpose of life, and the hope of eternal life. By using the Book of Mormon to address both spiritual and temporal questions, missionaries can effectively teach the gospel and provide guidance to those seeking answers. This dual focus on diligent work and the teachings of the Book of Mormon equips missionaries to engage personally with others and support them in their spiritual journeys."

In your study journal write a title that describes the central message. Then record your thoughts and feelings about this message, including how understanding it better has changed the way you live and the way you view the world around you. ## Helping Others Make Commitments: The Door to Faith and Repentance (Page 22) Help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “The first thing you will do when an investigator tells you he or she had not read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! . . . Much of the time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the balance. . . . It is the most important path this investigator will ever walk. But if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! . . . So take control of this situation. Teach with power and authority, and then be devastated if the first steps toward commandment-keeping and covenant-keeping have not been successfully begun” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1997).', '<2-hop>\n\nMission President (Page 128) - Teach the missionaries how to use the Book of Mormon to confirm the truthfulness of the message of the Restoration. - Read 1 Nephi 1 with the missionaries and compare it with Joseph Smith’s experience. - Provide missionaries with a clean paperback copy of the Book of Mormon. Have them highlight in different colors: - Each reference to Jesus Christ (any of His names or pronouns referring to Him). - His words (spoken by Him or by prophets when they say, “Thus saith the Lord”). - His attributes. - The doctrines and principles contained in the Book of Mormon. At the bottom of each page ask the missionaries to count the total number of items referenced. In interviews and during district meetings during the two- or three-month period for this activity, have missionaries share with each other what they’ve learned. You might consider doing a similar activity with the entire mission highlighting references to faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, or any of the fundamental principles of the gospel. - During interviews, invite missionaries to share with you Book of Mormon scriptures that have changed their lives. - Help missionaries see how the Book of Mormon teaches the doctrines from the missionary lessons. For example, if the topic were the Atonement, have missionaries write in one column each major element of the Atonement taught in the Book of Mormon, including its references. Then, in a second column, have them list side-by-side those same elements as taught in the Bible. Have your missionaries leave blank those elements that are missing or not taught in the Bible. It will become very evident to the missionary how the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our doctrine. This same activity can be done with the other doctrines that missionaries teach. - Identify pertinent questions of the soul for people in your mission. Invite missionaries to find answers in the Book of Mormon. > Beginning of Chapter 6 of 13 chapters in the preach my gospel manual # How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes? (Page 129) #### Consider This - How can I develop attributes that will make me a more powerful and effective minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ? - How will developing Christlike attributes help me fulfill my purpose as a missionary? - Which attribute do I most need to develop? ## Overview (Page 129) At the beginning of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ walked along the shore of the sea of Galilee and called out to two fishermen, Peter and Andrew. “Follow me,” He said, “and I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew 4:19; see also Mark 1:17). The Lord has also called you to His work, and He invites you to follow Him. The invitation to follow Christ is an invitation to follow His example and to become like Him. Some chapters in Preach My Gospel focus on what you need to do as a missionary—how to study, how to teach, how to manage time wisely. Just as vital as what you do, however, is who you are. The restored gospel enables you to become like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The Savior has shown the way. He has set the perfect example, and He commands us to become as He is (see 3 Nephi 27:27). Learn of Him and seek to incorporate His attributes into your life. Through the power of His Atonement, you can achieve this goal and lead others to achieve it also. The scriptures describe Christlike attributes that are essential for you to eventually develop as a missionary and throughout your life. Study the scripture passages in this chapter and look for other examples of Christlike attributes as you study other passages. Christlike attributes are gifts from God. They come as you use your agency righteously. Ask your Heavenly Father to bless you with these attributes; you cannot develop them without His help. With a desire to please God, recognize your weaknesses and be willing and anxious to improve. #### Scripture Study (Page 130) - What do these scriptures say about following Jesus Christ’s example? - 3 Nephi 12:48, John 13:1–16, 1 Peter 2:21, 3 Nephi 27:21, 27 - What is the relationship between the first principles of the gospel and Christlike attributes? - Moroni 8:25–26']","The teachings in 1 Nephi 13:39 and 1 Nephi 1 can significantly enhance missionary work by providing a scriptural foundation that confirms the truthfulness of the message of the Restoration. According to the Preach My Gospel manual, missionaries are encouraged to use the Book of Mormon, including passages like 1 Nephi 13:39, to demonstrate the fulfillment of prophecies and the coming forth of additional scripture that supports the Bible. This helps in teaching the Restoration's message effectively. Additionally, reading 1 Nephi 1 with missionaries and comparing it with Joseph Smith’s experience allows them to draw parallels between ancient and modern revelations, reinforcing the continuity and truth of the Restoration. These scriptures serve as a keystone in teaching true doctrine, inviting repentance, and helping individuals make and keep sacred covenants, thereby preparing them for baptism and confirmation."
How do D&C 84:85 and D&C 68:25 guide missionaries in teaching the gospel and strengthening families?,"['<1-hop>\n\nThe Power and Authority of Your Calling (Page 18) Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (D&C 79:1). You have authority to preach the gospel. If you hold the priesthood, you have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof. As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3). When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478). Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions. In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively. Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as: - Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see D&C 84:85). - Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see D&C 28:15; 31:11; 75:26–27). - Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1; D&C 100:5–8). - Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see D&C 84:19–20). - Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15). - Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6; 8:18–22; 10:7–11; 31:26–35; D&C 75:19). - Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve. #### Scripture Study (Page 19) - How do you receive power?

This guidance helps missionaries effectively teach the gospel with authority and power. D&C 68:25 highlights the role of families as the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles, underscoring the importance of strengthening family relationships through the gospel.

For example: - The Lord and His prophets have instructed us to do so (see D&C 42:12, 56–58; 71:1). A latter-day prophet counseled, “The words and the way they are used in the Book of Mormon by the Lord . . . should be used by us in teaching gospel principles” (Ezra Taft Benson, “The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants,” Ensign, May 1987, 84). - The scriptures invite the Holy Ghost into your teaching. They teach God’s word with power (see Alma 31:5). - The scriptures answer the great questions of the soul (see 2 Nephi 32:3; Jacob 2:8). - The scriptures give authority and validity to your teaching, even in areas without a Christian background. Your ability to teach with power from the scriptures comes in large measure from the time you personally spend studying them. As you daily feast upon the word, your ability to teach from the scriptures will improve. In addition, your invitations to study and ponder the scriptures will be more powerful because you are doing the same thing in your life. Help people gain faith in the scriptures— particularly the Book of Mormon—as sources of revealed truth. When people come to believe the scriptures, you will be better able to help them understand doctrines correctly. The following suggestions may help. 1. Introduce the scripture. Describe briefly the background and context of the passage you will use. Invite the investigator to look for particular points in the passage. When teaching people with a limited knowledge of the scriptures, you may need to begin by describing the contents of a passage, using language that they will understand. Below are examples of introducing a scripture: - “Here in Joseph Smith’s history we have Joseph’s own words telling what happened to him as he went into the grove to pray. He said, ‘I saw a pillar of light . . .’ ” - “In this passage the prophet Alma is teaching people who are poor to exercise their faith in the word of God. He compares the word of God to a seed that can be planted in our hearts. Will you begin reading verse . . .” 2. Read the passage. Read the verses aloud or ask the investigator to read aloud. Be sensitive to those who struggle to read. If a passage is difficult for them to understand, read with them carefully and help them understand the more difficult points. Or give them a simpler passage to read. You might also define difficult words or phrases: - “Let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not [‘upbraideth not’ means that God won’t find blame or fault] and it shall be given him” (James 1:5). Some scriptural passages are clear and need no explanation. For others you may take time to explain what has been read. 3. Apply the scripture. “Liken” the scriptures to yourself and to investigators by showing how the principles are relevant today (see 1 Nephi 19:23). Show investigators how they can apply the principles in their lives. As they do, they will come to know that the doctrine is true. Bear your testimony of the principle, and promise them blessings. For example: - “The people of Alma, like you, had heavy burdens placed on them, almost more than they could bear. But as they exercised faith and ‘cried mightily to God,’ He strengthened them so they could endure the challenges and then delivered them from their trials. Just as He did with these people, I know God will help you in your trials as you . . .” - “Alma’s instruction to the people at the waters of Mormon applies to us today. John, are you willing to . . .” The people you teach will differ widely in how they view sacred texts, how familiar they are with the Bible, how well they understand scriptural language, and how deeply they believe that the Bible contains God’s word. Help all investigators gain an appreciation for the scriptures. By effectively using the scriptures in your teaching, you can help investigators begin to study the scriptures on their own. After each visit, suggest specific chapters or verses for them to read. You might give them questions to consider as they read, which you can discuss in your next meeting. This will encourage them to study the scriptures daily in their homes and participate in Church meetings and classes where the scriptures are used.', '<2-hop>\n\nScripture Study (Page 107) **What do these scriptures teach about the power of the Spirit in your work?** - 2 Nephi 33:1–2, D&C 42:11–17, D&C 50:13–22, Acts 2:37–38 - 1 Corinthians 2:11–14 Bible Dictionary, “Conversion” **What can you do to enjoy the power of the Spirit in your work?** - Alma 32:27–28, D&C 42:14, John 7:17 **Why is it important to teach what you know and believe?** - Alma 5:43–47, D&C 52:9, D&C 80:4 ##']","D&C 42:12 emphasizes the importance of using scriptures in teaching by instructing that the standard works of the Church are the basic sources for teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. This directive is supported by the counsel of latter-day prophets, who have highlighted the necessity of using the scriptures to invite the Holy Ghost into teaching and to provide authority and validity to the teachings. On the other hand, D&C 42:14 underscores the role of the Spirit in missionary work by teaching that the Spirit's power is essential for effective teaching and conversion. It suggests that missionaries must have the Spirit with them to teach with power and authority, which can be achieved through personal study and application of the scriptures. Together, these sections highlight the intertwined importance of scripture and the Spirit in effective missionary work."
