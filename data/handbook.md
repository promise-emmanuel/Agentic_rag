# Message from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles

Dear Fellow Missionary:

After His Resurrection, Jesus Christ appeared to His disciples and commanded them to “make disciples of” (see Matthew 28:19, footnote a) “all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19–20).

You have been called by revelation through God’s chosen servants to assist the Apostles in this great work of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world in order to make disciples of all nations.

When you serve a mission with all your heart, you help fulfill the two great commandments: “Love the Lord thy God … [and] love thy neighbor as thyself” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5–6).

To be an effective missionary, you must be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. We invite you to enlarge your talents and skills for the glory of God. Jesus Christ will magnify you. Heavenly Father loves you, and He will help you to love and bless His children wherever you serve. He will empower you and the people you serve, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to be truly “converted unto the Lord” (Alma 23:6).

These missionary standards are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They will help protect you physically, spiritually, and emotionally and help you be the disciple Jesus Christ needs you to become.

If you have questions about a standard, prayerfully ask the Lord to help you understand its importance, and then if needed, ask your companion, your young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders for help. Regularly study these standards with your companion and strive to obey them.

We congratulate you for accepting a call to serve a full-time mission, and we pray you will find true peace and joy in serving the Lord Jesus Christ.

First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints


# Your Full-Time Missionary Experience
> 1.0

## Introduction

Your mission didn’t really begin the day you were set apart and won’t end the day you are released. A mission isn’t like putting on an employee or school uniform in the morning only to take it off again when the day is done. Since the time you were baptized, you have been on the covenant path that leads to eternal happiness, joy, and peace. Your full-time mission experience can be a transforming event but should also be an integral part of your life mission experience.

When seen from an eternal perspective, your full-time mission experience is more than a checkbox to be marked off—it is a means to continue becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ.

The Prophet Joseph Smith reflected on the blessings and privileges we have when we decide to become part of this great work of salvation. He asked the early Saints, “Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren [and sisters]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (Doctrine and Covenants 128:22).

Enjoy your missionary experience as you love God and love your neighbor. This is a time to rejoice and to experience lasting happiness and peace through Jesus Christ.

> 1.1

## Obedience
True disciples of Jesus Christ are obedient. The Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Keeping the commandments means that you willingly and faithfully do what the Lord asks because you love Him and also that you do so with “joyfulness” (Colossians 1:11) and “gladness and singleness of heart” (Acts 2:46).

Jesus Christ is the example of perfect faithfulness. He did only the Father’s will. Follow Him by doing your best to keep all of His commandments and live the missionary standards. Being faithful and obedient also means that you try to learn, grow, and improve; correct mistakes quickly; and take personal responsibility for your actions.

Your mission leaders will consistently help you learn how to apply the principles in this handbook.

You will be most safe when you follow the commandments and missionary standards and use common sense. But realize that even when you keep the commandments, you may experience trouble, sickness, or harm (see John 16:33). The Savior experienced all of these things (see Alma 7:11–12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8), and He promises, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18).

God loves you. Choose to keep the commandments because you love God. Do not try to make deals with the Lord and expect specific blessings by adjusting what is required of you. The requirements you are expected to uphold are approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and are found in these standards. For example, don’t try to bargain with the Lord by getting up earlier, going without food or drink (beyond the monthly fast), or skipping a preparation day.

> 1.2

## Standards for Life
God invites you to dedicate yourself to Him throughout your life. Mission standards such as personal study, goal setting, and the righteous use of technology will bless you on your mission and help you for the rest of your life.

Let the commandments in the scriptures, the principles in Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (2019), and the missionary standards outlined in this book become lifelong guiding principles. As you follow God’s commandments and standards, He will direct, bless, and guide you throughout your life.


# Missionary Organization and Activities
> 2.0

## Introduction
The Lord has said, “Ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man [and woman] his [or her] stewardship” (Doctrine and Covenants 104:11). This section of this handbook describes mission organization and explains how you can best work and live with a companion, participate in mission activities, plan daily schedules, and serve others with the pure love of Christ (see Moroni 7:44–47).

For clarity, these standards use the term young missionary leaders to refer to missionaries with leadership assignments, such as senior companions, sister training leaders, or zone leaders. Mission leaders refers to your mission president, who holds priesthood keys, and his wife.

These standards also use the terms bishop, stake president, ward, and stake. Apply the related guidelines as appropriate to branch presidents, district presidents, branches, and member districts.

> 2.1

## Mission Leadership
Your most important responsibility, regardless of any leadership assignment, is to be a faithful and dedicated missionary. This counsel from the Lord recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants also applies to you: “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this [generation], that you may bring souls unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 15:6).

> 2.1.1

### Mission Leaders: Your Mission President and His Wife
Your mission president and his wife, who serve together as your mission leaders, are called of God and set apart to lead the mission. Together they love and serve you, help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary, and help keep you safe and happy.

Your mission leaders share many responsibilities for the mission. They will work together to support and encourage you, listen to your concerns, answer questions, assess progress, and give counsel. Because your mission president holds certain priesthood keys, he acts as a common judge in the mission. Sexual transgression and other serious sins should be confessed to your mission president (see Mosiah 26:29–30). Be completely honest with him. He will help you repent (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022], “Jesus Christ will help you,” 6–9).

You may invite the mission president’s wife, a senior missionary, or your missionary companion to join any interview with the mission president. Your decision to invite someone to join you should not diminish your mission leaders’ love, concern, or admiration for you.

> 2.1.2

### Mission Presidency
Your mission president presides in the mission with priesthood keys. He is a member of a mission presidency with two counselors.

Counselors in the mission presidency, like counselors in a stake presidency or bishopric, help organize and assist in the work. Counselors in the mission presidency do not address matters of missionary worthiness.

> 2.1.3

### Mission Leadership Organization
Your mission president uses revelation and priesthood keys to organize the work. He assigns young missionaries to be trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants. Assistants, office missionaries, and other missionaries do not make missionary leadership assignments or assign the areas where you serve. However, the mission president may counsel with his wife or his assistants about missionary assignments.

Your mission leaders and the assistants, zone leaders, and sister training leaders are members of the mission leadership council. These leaders counsel about meeting the needs of the missionaries and make plans to help the mission progress and to move the work forward.

> 2.1.4

### Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities
Young missionary leaders, like all missionaries, follow the counsel of Jesus Christ to “serve [God] with all [their] heart, might, mind and strength” and to “remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence” (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2, 6). Leadership assignments do not indicate special recognition or advancement or reflect the worth of a missionary.

Young missionary leaders have the responsibility to:

- Find, teach, baptize, and fellowship people.

- Set an example of missionary standards for behavior (see 3.0).

- Train other missionaries and lead companion exchanges (see 2.3.1).

- Share information and direction from the mission leadership council with the missionaries they lead.

- Love and befriend other missionaries. Help them recognize the value of their efforts.

- Listen to other missionaries’ concerns. Give support and counsel.

- Correct other missionaries kindly and privately, as needed, followed by “an increase of love” (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–43).

- Work closely with local leaders and members.

Like all missionaries, elders and sisters with leadership assignments should practice Christlike leadership. If the conduct of any missionary, including young missionary leaders, seems inconsistent with the commandments and missionary standards, discuss the issue with the missionary. If the issue is not then resolved, share your concerns with your young missionary leaders or mission president and not with other missionaries, members, or friends.

For more information about the specific assignments and responsibilities of young missionary leaders (trainers, senior companions, district leaders, sister training leaders, zone leaders, and assistants to the president), see section 7.1, “Young Missionary Leadership Responsibilities.”

> 2.1.5

### Personal Responsibilities
“Magnify [your] office unto the Lord” (Jacob 1:19), become spiritually self-reliant, and “act for [yourself]” (2 Nephi 2:16) by trusting the Lord and following the Spirit. When you have questions or concerns:

Apply the teaching to “study it out in your mind; then … ask me if it be right” (Doctrine and Covenants 9:8).

Seek guidance through personal revelation; prayer; and study of the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets, and these standards.

If you need additional help after applying these principles, ask your companion or young missionary leaders. Often, they can help you find answers to your questions and resolve your concerns. If not, reach out to either of your mission leaders, your parents, or your home priesthood leaders. Please do not contact Church headquarters. If you do, you will be referred back to your mission president.

Talk with your mission president about worthiness issues. Talk with either of your mission leaders about immediate safety concerns, including assault or abuse, or other issues that cannot be resolved with other missionaries.

There may be times during your mission when you find it difficult to focus on your work due to current challenges, personal or family matters, or even past experiences. That is understandable. Do not hesitate to share your concerns with your companion, young missionary leaders, or either of your mission leaders and to reach out for support.

Remember the Savior’s invitation: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen” (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36–37).

> 2.2

## Companions
The Lord calls missionaries to preach His gospel in companionships. “Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands” (Doctrine and Covenants 52:10). You will work with different companions throughout your mission. Companions:

Become united in the work and together testify of Jesus Christ.

Support each other’s spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being.

Try to keep each other safe.

Are accountable to each other in keeping missionary standards.

> 2.2.1

### Supporting Each Other
Companions should help each other learn, grow, and develop Christlike attributes (see Doctrine and Covenants 4 and “How Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 6). Learning patience and love, practicing forgiveness, and accepting differences in personalities will bless you throughout your life.

As companions:

- Love, respect, and strengthen each other.

- Study together every day and pray together frequently throughout the day.

- Be humble and recognize each other’s strengths.

- Treat each other as you would like to be treated.

- Avoid criticism and contention.

- Avoid speaking negatively about each other to other missionaries, Church members, or family and friends at home.

If you notice any inappropriate situation or behavior, discuss it with your companion. If the matter is not resolved or if your companion is being abusive, have the courage and love for your companion to ask your mission president for help (see 3.9.2).

> 2.2.2

### Staying Together
Staying with your companion will help provide protection from physical and spiritual dangers, false accusations, and loneliness. Obey this missionary standard at all times and in all places. Never be alone.

You should be able to see and hear your companion at all times unless you are in the bathroom, in an interview with a mission leader, or conducting a baptismal interview (see 2.3.6).

You should sleep in the same room but not the same bed.

When doing individual tasks while in your housing, use common sense to protect yourselves and follow missionary standards of behavior (see 3.0).

Do not create time to be alone. For example, do not stay up later or get up earlier than your companion.

If you and your companion become separated, contact your mission president immediately.

> 2.2.3

### Working in Your Area
“Go and labor with [your] mights” (Jacob 5:72), and concentrate your efforts in your assigned teaching area. Focus your work in areas where you are more likely to help people make and keep covenants. For example, focus on neighborhoods near a church building or in a neighborhood where committed members live. Remember the Lord’s promise: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88).

You may leave your assigned area for companion exchanges (see 2.3.1) or transfers (see 2.3.2). If you need to leave your area for another reason, request permission from your district leader to leave your area within your district or from your zone leaders if you need to travel outside of your district. You need permission from your mission president, or a person he designates, to leave your zone.

If you need to leave your assigned area because of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an assault or to seek emergency medical attention, seek safety or medical care first and then contact your mission president or your young missionary leaders as soon as you are able.

> 2.2.4

### Working with People outside Your Area
During your mission you will likely encounter people who live outside your assigned area. If they are interested in learning about the gospel of Jesus Christ, you may:

Share a message with them.

Connect with them on approved social media (see 7.5.6).

Refer them to missionaries where they live and share information about them with the assigned missionaries (see 2.3.4).

With your mission president’s permission, use technology (see 7.5.4) to work with the missionaries where the individuals live to help teach and support them. You can also invite your own family and friends to help teach them, with permission (see 3.9.5).

When working with other missionaries or members both inside and outside of your area or mission:

Counsel together to know how to best help the interested person come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.

Be respectful of the members’ or other missionaries’ time.

Let the missionaries assigned to the area where the person lives take the lead in teaching as soon as reasonably possible.

> 2.3

## Missionary Work Activities
Missionaries participate in a variety of activities to fulfill the Lord’s command to “prepare every needful thing” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:119) in order to accomplish His work. These activities include participating in companion exchanges and transfers, working with members, responding to referrals, teaching, participating in councils and meetings, and serving. Elders may also conduct baptismal interviews as part of their missionary activities.

> 2.3.1

### Companion Exchanges
In a companion exchange, a young missionary leader, such as a sister training leader or assistant to the president, works with another missionary. During the exchange the leader will teach, train, and learn from the missionary. The leader will follow the Lord’s counsel found in the Doctrine and Covenants to strengthen the other missionary “in all [their] conversation, in all [their] prayers, in all [their] exhortations, and in all [their] doings” (Doctrine and Covenants 108:7).

- Young missionary leaders are responsible for planning exchanges with the missionaries they lead. Sisters conduct exchanges with other sisters, and elders conduct exchanges with other elders.

- In most missions, young missionary leaders generally conduct companion exchanges once every transfer.

- District leaders conduct exchanges with each elder in their district.

- Zone leaders conduct exchanges with each district leader and as needed with other elders in their zone.

- Sister training leaders conduct exchanges with each sister in their assigned zone or zones.

- Assistants to the president conduct exchanges with zone leaders or other elders as directed by the mission president.

- A companion exchange generally lasts about 24 hours. For each companion exchange, the young missionary leader should:

- Conduct companion exchanges in the young missionary leader’s area. At times, exchanges may also be conducted in the missionary’s area when appropriate.

- Plan the companion exchange in advance.

- Work together to set goals with the missionary about what to accomplish during the exchange. Participate in all parts of missionary work, including finding, teaching, companion study, language study (if applicable), daily planning, and fellowshipping.

- Train using the scriptures and principles from Preach My Gospel.

- Review and discuss people the missionaries are working with or teaching.

- Give the missionary specific, helpful feedback, including what the missionary does well and how the missionary can improve.

- Be open to feedback from the missionary on areas for improvement.

- Review and discuss what each missionary learned during the companion exchange.

- Report on the companion exchange in the weekly letter to the mission president.

> 2.3.2

### Transfers
The mission office will arrange your travel during a transfer so that you are not alone. In a few instances, because of distances and other considerations, your mission president may direct otherwise. In these situations, be particularly careful, use common sense, and follow the Spirit.

When you are transferred:

- Go directly to your new area to join your new companion.

- Do not eat or drink anything you have left unattended while traveling.

- When you travel, make sure your phone has sufficient battery life for the trip. If you are traveling alone for more than three hours, check in periodically with the mission office.

- If your companion is transferred and you are not, work with other missionaries, as assigned by your young missionary leaders, until your new companion arrives.

> 2.3.3

### Opportunities to Teach with Members
Invite members to join you in normal and natural ways as you find, teach, baptize, and fellowship. Encourage and help members to befriend the people you are teaching and to invite those people to participate in ward and family activities. Ask members to share relevant personal experiences and their testimonies.

Missionaries need to remain together in companionships. Therefore, there are no missionary exchanges with members. However, female members (at least age 16, but older as needed to comply with local laws) may accompany and teach with two or more sister missionaries. Male members (at least age 16, but older as needed to comply with local laws) may accompany and teach with two or more elder missionaries. Married couples may teach with sisters or elders.

> 2.3.4

### Referrals
A referral is when someone has made a request for the missionaries to contact him or her.

When working with people who have been referred to you:

- Contact the missionaries, members, or individuals who gave the referral, if possible. Counsel with them about how to help the person.

- Attempt to contact the person who was referred as soon as possible, generally within 24 hours.

- Listen to and learn how to help the person who was referred.

- Deliver any requested items.

- Teach to the person’s needs and interests.

- Continue to work with the missionaries, members, or individuals who provided the referral (see 2.2.4).

For more information on referrals, see “Member, Missionary, and Church Headquarters Referrals” in “How Do I Find People to Teach?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 9.

> 2.3.5

### Meetings and Councils
Missionaries counsel together as they give and receive training and as they plan and coordinate missionary work. Meetings and councils should invite the Spirit of the Lord and should be a time for revelation (see Doctrine and Covenants 6:32). Additionally, gathering as missionaries will provide you the opportunity to edify each other and rejoice in your labors together (see Doctrine and Covenants 43:8; 50:22).

Meetings that are organized by missionary companionships, young missionary leaders, and mission leaders include the following:

- Daily and weekly planning sessions

- District council meetings

- Zone conferences

- Mission leadership council meetings

- Meetings organized by local leaders include the following:

- Missionary coordination meetings

- Ward council meetings

> 2.3.6

Baptismal Interviews
When conducting a baptismal interview, elders should:

- Review what the Lord has said in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37.

- Follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost.

- Ask the baptismal interview questions found in the “Baptismal Interview Questions” section of chapter 12 in Preach My Gospel.

- Adapt the questions to the age and maturity of the individual.

- Be sure that the elders quorum president or ward mission leader is aware of the baptismal interview in advance.

- If the baptismal candidate desires, he or she may invite a parent, spouse, or other adult to join the baptismal interview. Be sensitive to a person’s feelings about his or her spouse or minor child being interviewed. Follow the guidelines in Preach My Gospel for interviewing and obtaining permission to baptize spouses and minor children (see “How to Conduct the Interview” in “How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 12).

- District leaders interview baptismal candidates taught by missionaries in their district, including those taught by the assistants to the president, zone leaders, and sister training leaders in their district.

- Zone leaders interview baptismal candidates taught by district leaders in their zone.

- If the assigned district and zone leaders are not available, the mission president may assign another elder to conduct the interview.

> 2.3.7

### Baptisms
Work with the elders quorum president or the ward mission leader to arrange baptismal services (see “The Baptismal Service” in “How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 12). Begin preparations for the baptismal service as soon as possible.

> 2.4

## Daily Activities and Schedule
Plan your schedule to fulfill your missionary purpose and focus on the needs of others. Remember what the Lord has promised to those who are called to preach the gospel: “And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!” (Doctrine and Covenants 18:15).

> 2.4.1

Typical Daily Activities
Include the following activities in your daily schedule:

- Set and review personal, companion, and mission goals.

- Plan your schedule for the day.

- Prepare lessons.

- Study the scriptures, Preach My Gospel, teachings of the living prophets and apostles, and other approved resources (see 2.4.4).

- Review one health or safety topic or one of the safeguards for using technology (see 4.0–4.7).

- Find people to teach.

- Work with local leaders and members.

- Serve others in planned or unplanned activities.

- Take care of personal needs, such as eating meals and preparing for the day.

> 2.4.2

Sample Daily Schedule
The daily schedule for your mission may look something like the schedule below. Daily schedules may be adjusted by the mission president for holidays, special events in your mission, and so forth.

| Time | Event| 
|-------|-----|
| 6:30 a.m | Begin the day |
| 6:30–10:00 a.m |Pray, Exercise (30 minutes), Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day, Have personal study (60 minutes), Plan (30 minutes). |
| 10:00 a.m.–9:00 p.m | Find, teach, and serve others, Update digital or paper records throughout the day, Briefly review a health or safety topic or one of the safeguards for using technology, Hold companion study and prepare lessons (30 minutes), Study additional materials for new missionaries and trainers during the first 12 weeks in the field (30–60 minutes, if applicable), If learning a new language, study the language (30–60 minutes). You are encouraged to study English if you are a non-English speaker, Eat lunch and dinner (no more than two hours combined). |
|9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing, unless you have a teaching appointment; if so, return by 9:30 p.m. |
| 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray.
| 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. |


*Your daily activities should focus on interacting with people. Spread your planning and study activities throughout the day to avoid spending long periods of time in your apartment. If distance and time permit, you may leave and return to your apartment throughout the day to meet these needs.

The schedule approved for your mission will allow time to work, rest, and refocus. It is important to get adequate rest and nutrition for your spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being.

> 2.4.3
### Goal Setting and Planning Sessions
Hold daily and weekly planning sessions with your companion. Consider the needs of those you are teaching and how to work with members as you review progress, set goals, and make plans for the day and for the week (see “How to Set Goals,” “The Weekly Planning Session,” and “Daily Planning Session” in “How Do I Use Time Wisely?” in Preach My Gospel, chapter 8).

> 2.4.4

### Study Sessions
Use your personal and companion study time to focus on the scriptures (especially the Book of Mormon), Preach My Gospel, the teachings of living prophets (found in Gospel Library), and these standards. These approved resources can strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and help you prepare to meet the needs of those you teach.

If you have been assigned to learn a new language, study and practice it daily.

If you are a new missionary, study with your trainer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes each day for the first 12 weeks in the mission field (see “For New Missionaries: Additional Companion Study” in “Introduction: How Can I Best Use Preach My Gospel?” in Preach My Gospel).

> 2.4.5

### Meals with Others
If applicable, your mission president and the local stake president will provide guidelines for scheduling meals with people in your mission. When members or others provide meals:

- Be respectful of their personal situations and time.

- Be grateful for the food they offer.

- Ask to teach a 15- or 20-minute lesson before or after the meal to strengthen those you visit and to provide you with an opportunity to improve your ability to teach by the Spirit.

- Another adult of your own gender should be present with you and your companion when you eat a meal with someone of the opposite gender.

> 2.5

## Preparation Day
Your mission president will assign one day each week as a preparation day. Preparation day allows you time to refresh physically, spiritually, and emotionally as you “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (Mosiah 18:9). It will also provide you and your companion with opportunities to be with other missionaries in your district and to enjoy wholesome recreational activities together (see 3.6).

Please remember the Lord’s timely warnings: “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (Doctrine and Covenants 10:4), and “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:124).

> 2.5.1

### Preparation Day Activities
Preparation day activities may include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Communicating with your family, mission president, and friends (see 3.9)

- Doing laundry

- Getting haircuts and other personal grooming

- Cleaning

- Shopping

- Resting

- Participating in approved recreational activities (see 3.6)

> 2.5.2

### Sample Preparation Day Schedule
A preparation day schedule might look something like the following:

| Time | Event |
| ----- | -----|
| 6:30 a.m. | Begin the day.
| 6:30–8:00 a.m. |
- Pray.

- Shower, eat breakfast, and prepare for the day.

- Plan (30 minutes).

- Have personal study (30 minutes). |

| 8:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. |
 - Do preparation day activities (see 2.5.1).

 - Note: All preparation day activities should be completed by 6:00 p.m. |

| 6:00–9:00 p.m. | Find, teach, and serve others. |
| 9:00 p.m. | Return to your housing. If you have a teaching appointment, return by 9:30 p.m. |
| 9:00–9:30 p.m. | Write in your journal, prepare for bed, and pray. |
| 9:30–10:30 p.m. | Go to bed. |


> 2.6

## Sabbath Day Activities
Plan activities on the Sabbath that help you fulfill your missionary purpose to find, teach, baptize, and help others learn about and become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Remember the Lord’s teachings about the Sabbath day in Doctrine and Covenants 59:13–19, and note the words and phrases that suggest that a true Sabbath includes joy, rejoicing, a glad heart, and a cheerful countenance.

Sabbath day activities include attending church, general conference, Sunday general sessions of stake conference, and additional meetings like ward council when invited. They also include participating in the monthly fast.

In your missionary efforts, the Lord has not asked you to go without food, except during the regular monthly fast, or to sacrifice sleep in order to be a more dedicated missionary. You may occasionally fast for a special reason, but do not fast for more than 24 hours at a time.

> 2.7

## Service in the Community
You can learn to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by serving as He did. Find opportunities to serve your companion, the people you are teaching, members, and others in the community, “that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17).

You should serve with a sincere desire to help others without any expected outcomes. Follow all service project rules (see 7.2), especially any about not teaching while serving and not serving where you would be alone with children. If someone expresses interest in your message, reply very briefly and arrange to meet with them at a different time and location to share a message.

For more information see section 7.2, “Guidelines for Service.”


# Missionary Conduct

> 3.0

## Introduction
This section describes missionary standards of behavior and Christlike qualities you are expected to practice and develop during your mission as you become a more dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. As the prophet Moroni counseled, “Remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also” (Moroni 7:5).

> 3.1

## Christlike Behavior
Pray and work to develop Christlike attributes as described in the scriptures and in Preach My Gospel, including gratitude, kindness, love, humility, patience, empathy, and obedience. With the Savior’s help and your own sincere and diligent efforts, you can develop Christlike attributes (see Mosiah 3:19).

- Be kind, positive, and uplifting. Be thoughtful of each person’s situation, asking yourself questions such as these:

- Is it too late or early to contact this person? Would this inappropriately interrupt family or personal time?

- Is there a way I can be helpful in this situation?

- Could this action or comment embarrass, intimidate, or offend someone?

- What is appropriate for this culture?

You are a guest in the area where you serve and should treat people and places with respect and appreciation. Respect the customs, religious beliefs and practices, and sacred sites in your area at all times. Be careful that your actions will not offend anyone. Remember, what you say and what you do may be heard, observed, and recorded.

For more information see section 7.3, “Respect for Others,” and General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38.6.14, “Prejudice,” in the Gospel Library.

> 3.2

## Temple Worthiness
The Lord Jesus Christ invites you to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:74). Part of this preparation includes keeping your temple covenants.

> 3.2.1

### Temple Covenants
Keeping temple covenants of obedience, sacrifice, and consecration will empower you and help you become more like the Savior.

Even if there is not a temple in your mission, keep a current temple recommend to help remind you of your covenants. Ask your mission president for a temple recommend interview before your recommend expires.

> 3.2.2

### Temple Worship
If a temple is nearby, your mission president may allow you and other missionaries to attend occasionally on preparation day.

For more information see section 7.4, “Temple Attendance.”

> 3.3

## The Law of Chastity
One temple covenant you have made is to obey the law of chastity. Do all you can to protect yourself, your companion, and others from sexual temptation that could lead to breaking this sacred covenant. Doing things that break the law of chastity may even be considered criminal in some areas.

You should avoid any thought or action that would separate you from the Spirit of God. This includes but is not limited to adultery; fornication; same-sex activity; oral sex; arousing sexual feelings; inappropriate touching; sending or receiving messages, images, or videos that are immoral or sexual in nature; masturbation; and viewing or using pornography (see 7.5.3). See For the Strength of Youth, “Your body is sacred,” 22–29, for additional information.

The Lord has taught, “Satan seeketh to destroy” (Doctrine and Covenants 132:57) and make you “miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will use people, inappropriate media, and other temptations to deceive, trap, threaten, and embarrass you. For example, be especially careful of those who may demand financial payment in return for not revealing compromising or inappropriate images and messages that you may have sent them.

If you are struggling to keep these standards or if someone is threatening you, ask the Lord for help and talk with your mission president immediately.

> 3.4

## Honesty
Temple worthiness includes being honest in all your dealings with others. In missionary service, this includes:

Telling the truth, especially to your mission president regarding your conduct, testimony, work habits, and emotional and physical health.

Giving accurate reports of your work and how you have spent your time throughout the week in your weekly reports.

Using mission funds responsibly and turning in accurate receipts.

Being trustworthy and never giving a false report or false information about any person, including your companion.

Respecting others by not borrowing, taking, or using someone’s personal items (including clothing, books, electronic devices, and jewelry) without permission.

> 3.5

## Interactions with Others
The Savior taught, “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you” (John 15:12). Choose to follow the Savior’s example and act in ways that are polite, safe, and appropriate for the situation.

> 3.5.1

### General Standards for Interacting with Adults
Build trust and meaningful relationships with those you serve, including people you teach, other missionaries, and local members. Be professional and kind, and observe these standards:

Always stay with your companion.

Do not counsel adults about personal problems. Refer members to their bishop if they need counseling. If you feel someone of another faith needs help with personal problems, talk to your mission president.

Avoid situations that could become physically or spiritually dangerous or that could be misunderstood.

Do not flirt or associate inappropriately with anyone. Limit physical contact with someone of the opposite gender to a handshake.

Always ensure that another adult of your own gender is present with you and your companion when you visit in person, teach in person, travel with, or have meals with an individual of the opposite gender. Seek approval from your mission president for any exceptions.

Keep your language dignified and avoid using slang. Use appropriate titles when addressing others. For example, use the title of “Elder” or “Sister” when referring to other missionaries to show respect for their calling.

> 3.5.2

### General Standards for Interacting with Children
For your safety and the safety of children, strictly observe the following guidelines:

Always stay with your companion.

Never be alone with anyone younger than age 18.

Be cautious about playing with groups of children, such as joining a soccer or other game. Do not do anything where your actions might be misinterpreted.

Whenever possible, get a parent’s permission to interact with a child.

Do not tickle children, change diapers, hold or hug children, or allow children to sit on your lap. These actions could appear inappropriate or be misinterpreted.

Politely decline to babysit children of any age.

Do not participate in service activities where you would be alone with children (see 7.2.2).

> 3.6

## Recreation
You can learn to more fully love the people you serve by taking sincere interest in their culture, history, land, and traditions through visits to local places of interest, generally on preparation day (see 2.5).

Ask those you meet to recommend appropriate and safe sites to visit. Choose activities that are uplifting and that help you relax. Appropriate places to visit may include (but are not limited to) the following:

Historical and cultural sites

Museums and galleries

Zoos and parks

> 3.6.1

### General Recreation Standards
Avoid gathering as large groups of missionaries in public places. Normally, this means you should not gather in groups larger than the size of your district. Doing so can draw unnecessary attention or make people feel intimidated.

Use mission vehicles only for activities that are authorized by your mission president.

Exercise and be active to keep your body fit for missionary work. Play sports in ways that avoid injury and extreme fatigue.

> 3.6.2

### Unauthorized Activities
Always be safe and use common sense when participating in recreational activities. Because missionaries have been seriously injured while participating in risky activities, you should not participate in activities during your mission that involve increased risk. These activities include but are not limited to the following:

- Contact, gymnastic, winter, and water sports (including swimming)

- Mountain climbing and rock climbing

- Riding on motorcycles and horses

- Riding in private boats or airplanes

- Handling firearms

- Using fireworks or explosives of any kind


> 3.6.3

### Media
Choose approved and appropriate media to invite the Spirit and to help you fulfill your missionary purpose. This generally means:

- Using social media, mobile apps, and online media that are approved for your mission in teaching the gospel and communicating with your family and friends (see 3.9).

- Avoiding television, movies, video games, and unauthorized videos.

- Choosing audiobooks, music, and reading material that increase your faith in Jesus Christ. They should be sacred, invite the Spirit, and be uplifting (see General Handbook, 19.1).

- Refer to missionary technology standards for more information (see 7.5). Discuss questions about media with your mission leaders.

> 3.6.4

### Musical Instruments
If approved by your mission president, you may bring a musical instrument to the mission field. It should be inexpensive, easy to transport, and able to meet baggage requirements. The type of instrument should be appropriate for Sunday meetings (see General Handbook, 19.3.6).

You may practice the instrument on preparation day and at other times your mission president designates. When playing the instrument, consider your neighbors and other missionaries and how they may be affected. The type of music you play on the instrument should be sacred, dignified, and suitable for missionary work.

> 3.7

## Photos and Videos
Photos can help you share your mission experience with people at home and can be meaningful reminders of your mission. When taking photos or recording videos, be careful not to embarrass anyone, including other missionaries and people who struggle with economic, social, or physical challenges. Some people may not want you or others to see, share, or be reminded of what is shown in a photo. Ask permission before taking and sharing photos or videos. In some missions, you may not be allowed to publicly share photos of anyone you are teaching because of local privacy laws.

Taking certain photos may be offensive or illegal in some cultures and places. Some examples include taking photos of:

- Certain government and military buildings.

- Security areas at airports, passport checks, border crossings, consulates, and embassies.

- Law enforcement or military personnel.

- People, buildings, or activities of other faiths.

- Culturally sensitive subjects, including people in traditional dress.

- People struggling with poverty, sickness, or disabilities.

- As a general guideline, do not take photos of the objects, places, or people listed above. Discuss any questions you may have with your mission leaders.

The Church also has specific policies about taking photographs at meetinghouses:

- Do not take pictures or record video in meetinghouse chapels.

- Do not photograph, send, or record sacred ordinances, including the sacrament and baptisms and confirmations.

> 3.8

## Use of Technology
The Lord declared, “Behold, I will hasten my work in its time” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:73). Technology can be a tool to share teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ and should be used righteously.

For more information see section 7.5, “Technology.”

> 3.9

## Communication with Family, Mission Leaders, and Friends
Your family, mission leaders, and friends can be a great support to you on your mission. Communicate on preparation day with your family and people from other areas, including members and those you have taught. Strengthen them as you share spiritual experiences and testimony.

When you communicate with other people (besides your family), you should limit your communication to email or letter and not by phone or video chat, unless approved by your mission president.

Prioritize your time on preparation day by communicating with your parents first and your mission president second.

Be wise in determining the duration of your communication. In making these decisions, be considerate of your companion and keep in mind the purpose of your missionary service.

You may read any communications you receive during the week whenever you have appropriate time to do so. You should reply to communications only on preparation day unless it is an emergency (see 3.9.7).

> 3.9.1

### Family
You may communicate with your family on your weekly preparation day via letters, emails, text messages, online messaging, phone calls, and video chat.

Use the approved communication method that works best for you and your family and that is cost-effective so that you can stay within your monthly budget. This will vary depending on circumstances, location, and schedule.

If your parents live in different locations, you may contact each parent separately on preparation day.

You also are encouraged to contact your family on other special occasions, such as Christmas, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, your parents’ birthdays, and other holidays that are significant in your home country or culture.

You should initiate all text message conversations, online messaging, phone calls, and video chats. If your family needs to contact you, they should contact the mission president first.

When communicating with your family by phone or video chat, be wise in determining the duration of your calls. In making these decisions, be considerate of your companion and keep in mind the purpose of your missionary service.

> 3.9.2

### Mission President
Write a letter to your mission president weekly on preparation day. Generally, you will submit your letter to him using the Missionary Portal.

Only your mission president will review your weekly letter. Be open and honest so that he can understand any concerns you have and provide relevant counsel and feedback. Please be aware that he will read but not be able to respond to every letter.

If you receive important news from home that needs immediate attention, inform your mission president and check with him before contacting your family on days other than preparation day or on special occasions.

> 3.9.3

### Communicating with People in Your Mission
As you contact people from other areas in your mission, be sure that your communication is focused on fulfilling your missionary purpose. Follow the standards in section 3.5.1, “General Standards for Interacting with Adults,” and in Safeguards for Using Technology, and remember to include your companion as you participate in these communications.

> 3.9.4

### Packages and Letters
Some missions may use the mission office address to receive mail and packages and as your return address. This practice can protect your safety and help prevent mail theft and lost mail due to transfers. Please follow all guidelines you receive in such cases.

> 3.9.5

### Missionary Experiences with People from Home
You may know a person at home whose personal experience could help someone you are teaching in your mission. You should ask your mission president for permission for that person to share her or his experience and testimony. Counsel with the person about the best communication technology to use.

If your family or friends from home want to learn more about the gospel of Jesus Christ, your mission president may allow you to teach them using technology (see 7.5.4).

> 3.9.6

### Personal Visits from Family and Friends
Generally, family and friends should not visit you during your mission. However, under special circumstances, your mission president may approve an exception. These visits should be short and not interfere with your missionary duties. A visit should not inconvenience your companion, other missionaries, or the people you teach. Take care that any such visit does not pull your thoughts away from your service or create a financial problem for your family.

> 3.9.7

### Emergencies
If your family tells you of an emergency at home, let your mission leaders know so they can give you support. Mission leaders will contact your family if you have an emergency situation.




# Physical Well-Being
> 4.0

## Introduction
Missionary work requires physical and emotional commitment. The standards in this section and in Adjusting to Missionary Life will help you prepare your mind and body to better serve the Lord and His cause. Regularly review these standards throughout your mission.

> 4.1

## Nutrition and Food Preparation
Proper hydration and nutrition are important to your well-being.

> 4.1.1

### General Nutrition Guidelines
Please follow the general nutrition guidelines below:

- Drink 6 to 12 glasses (48 to 96 ounces, or 1.5 to 3 liters) of clean water daily. You may need more water and salt if you sweat heavily throughout the day or during exercise.

- Eat balanced meals that include vegetables, fruits, grains, healthy fats, and protein.

- Limit junk food, carbonated drinks, processed foods, and restaurant fast food.

> 4.1.2

### Safe Food Preparation
Observe the following guidelines to ensure that your food is prepared safely:

- Wash food preparation surfaces with clean, hot, soapy water before and after cooking.

- Clean cooking and eating utensils with clean, hot, soapy water after each use.

- Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood separate from other foods while cooking.

- Cook meat, fish, and poultry thoroughly.

- Avoid eating undercooked or raw meats.

- Peel raw fruits and vegetables, or wash them thoroughly.

- Refrigerate leftovers and foods that will spoil. To avoid getting sick, throw away any items that have been left out longer than the time recommended on the package.

- Try to avoid eating foods from street vendors, because food quality and preparation safety are unknown.

- Apply these guidelines consistently, even if others (including other missionaries) try to convince you they are not important or are extreme.

> 4.1.3

### Water and Dairy Safety
Only clean water and pasteurized dairy products are safe for you to drink or eat.

Follow these and any additional guidelines provided by your mission:

- Use a water filter if you are serving in an area where purified water is not readily available.

- Use clean water to brush your teeth and to wash and prepare food.

- Eat only pasteurized dairy products.

- Be aware that in some locations, ice cubes and soft drinks at restaurants or markets may be made from unpurified water. Be cautious, and do not consume ice or soft drinks if they may not be safe.

> 4.2

## Exercise
Exercise keeps you healthy and helps relieve stress. Make it a part of your daily routine (see 2.4.2). Contact the mission office if you have any questions. Follow mission-specific guidelines as well as the following general guidelines:

- Get different kinds of exercise during the week, including cardio, strength, and flexibility training. For your safety, avoid lifting heavy weights.

- If you have a mobile device, you may use an app approved by your mission leaders to plan your exercise.

- You should not exercise at public or commercial gyms.

> 4.3

## Stress Management
Missionary work is demanding, and feeling stress from time to time is normal. You can prepare your body and mind to better handle stress by taking advantage of family support (see 3.9.1) and by practicing habits of healthy eating (see 4.1.1), regular exercise (see 4.2), regular sleep, relaxation, and spirituality (including praying, pondering, and studying).

Throughout your mission, use Adjusting to Missionary Life to help you manage your stress and to help other missionaries. If you feel that you or your companion has difficulty managing stress in healthy ways, or if there is an emergency, contact your mission leaders.

If you have been prescribed medication for stress, follow the prescription and your doctor’s directions.

The Apostle Paul reflected on his missionary efforts and taught that the Lord will sustain, support, and help those who seek Him. The Lord will never abandon you. Paul taught:

“For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. … We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. … We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. … For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:6, 8–9, 13, 17).

For more information see section 7.6, “Difficult Situations.”

> 4.4

## Medical Care
Take your physical and emotional health seriously. Make the mission medical coordinator aware of all medical issues (such as medications you are taking, allergies you have, or activities you should avoid) so you get the support you need. Contact the mission office if you have any questions about health concerns.

For your safety:

- Do not share prescribed medications with anyone or use someone else’s prescribed medications.

- Do not have family or friends send you medications that are restricted in the country or area in which you serve.

- If you have a health emergency, take common sense actions for your immediate safety or care. Call local emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) unless you have been given other instructions in your mission. As soon as possible, contact your mission leaders.

- If you need nonemergency medical care, call the mission medical coordinator right away. Nonemergency visits should be approved in advance by the medical coordinator. The medical coordinator can direct you to a medical care provider in your area.

For more information see section 7.7, “Physical and Mental Health Concerns.”

> 4.5

## Dangerous Situations and Threats
Many possible dangers can be avoided with common sense and by observing mission standards, including staying where you can see and hear your companion. However, people may still harm you even when you try to be safe. If there is a problem, immediately report it to either of your mission leaders.

Leave immediately if you or your companion feels uncomfortable about a location, person, or situation (including a teaching situation). Listen to spiritual promptings. You may leave your companion if you feel he or she may be a danger to you. If you leave your companion, call either of your mission leaders immediately.

For more information see section 7.8, “Dangerous Situations.”

> 4.6

## Housing
Show respect for your housing, the property owner or host, and your neighbors. If you cause damage, you are responsible to pay for repairs using your personal funds. Talk with the mission housing coordinator if you have any concerns about your housing.

For more information see section 7.9, “Housing Safety.”

> 4.7

## Transportation
Always follow local traffic rules, laws, and customs as you travel. Use common sense, be aware of your surroundings, become familiar with your area, and follow the general safety standards in this handbook.

For more information see section 7.10, “Transportation Safety.”

> 4.8

## Money
Missionary support funds represent the sacrifice of individual members of the Church. They are sacred funds, and you should use them responsibly, honestly, and with complete integrity.

> 4.8.1

### Missionary Support Funds
Use missionary support funds to pay for personal items to support you in missionary work. With certain exceptions, generally you should use all your missionary support funds each month. Do not save money from these funds or give any of the money to anyone else, including anyone at home. Do not loan or borrow money.

Your budget for missionary support funds might include the following:

- Fast offerings paid to the ward or branch where you are serving.

- Food to prepare nutritious meals (see 4.1.1).

- Transportation, including gas or public transportation.

- Hair care and personal hygiene items.

- Cleaning and laundry supplies.

- Postage or internet expenses for weekly communications home (see 3.8).

- Limited restaurant or fast-food meals.

- You do not need to pay tithing on missionary support funds.

See 4.8.2 for a list of items that should be paid for with personal funds.

> 4.8.2

### Personal Funds
Personal funds are money sent directly to you from home. Use personal funds for items such as:

- Clothing and shoe replacements.

- Bicycle purchase, maintenance, and repairs.

- Medical expenses not paid by the mission, such as copayments, normal eye or dental visits, and care for preexisting conditions.

- Traffic and parking fines.

- Repairs to housing if you cause damage.

- Audio or video devices.

- Souvenirs and gifts.

Tithing on personal funds received and any income from a business or investments at home should be paid with personal funds through your home ward or through online donations.

> 4.8.3

### Self-Reliance and Spending Plan
Become self-reliant during your mission by creating and following a spending plan. This skill will help and bless you throughout your life. Do not ask companions or family for extra funds unless it is an emergency.

Creating and following a spending plan includes making a list of everything you must buy for the month and then choosing what items are most important and paying for them first. Always choose what you need before choosing what you want.

If you need additional money or have questions about expenses, talk to the financial secretary or to your mission leaders.

> 4.9

## Dress and Appearance
As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ and His restored Church, your appearance is often the first message others receive. It should be consistent with the sacred message you are called to share. Throughout your mission, make sure that your appearance and behavior help others focus on that message.

> 4.9.1

### General Standards for Dress and Appearance
Certain items and styles of clothing will be recommended to fit the culture and climate of your mission. On preparation day, you should wear regular missionary clothing in public. However, if necessary for a specific activity, you may wear more casual clothing. Please review standards found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-and-appearance. This website provides examples of appropriate, professional dress for your mission. Your mission leaders and the Area Presidency may modify these guidelines to accommodate local circumstances.

See 7.7.4 for additional information on how to protect your skin from animal and insect bites.

> 4.9.2

### General Standards for Grooming
Follow healthy grooming standards:

- Bathe daily, if possible.

- Brush your teeth regularly.

- Use deodorant daily.

- Wash your hair frequently.

- Wash your hands regularly, including before preparing food and after using the toilet.

- Wear sunscreen.

- Choose a neat, professional hairstyle that is easy to maintain.




# Priesthood Authority and Ordinances

Priesthood is the authority that God gives His children to bring salvation to all. Priesthood authority is governed by priesthood leaders who receive and exercise priesthood keys. Since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:5), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority.

When a woman is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she acts under priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. Anyone with a calling received from someone holding priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties.

If you are a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you will have opportunities to participate in priesthood ordinances and blessings.

For more information see section 7.11, “Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings.”

# Completion of Your Mission
> 6.0

## Introduction
Prepare yourself now to continue your life as a disciple of Jesus Christ and as a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when you return home and as you fulfill your life’s mission.

> 6.1

## Staying Connected
Continue to communicate with those you have taught and worked with on your mission, including your mission leaders. Support and strengthen them through your words and example, and celebrate important events in their lives.

> 6.2

## Returning Home from Your Mission
Because you remain a missionary until you have been released by your stake president, you are expected to follow all missionary standards until that time. Consider returning home directly. This is especially important if you are serving in a country other than your own where visa requirements are enforced. Delaying your return home could make it difficult for future missionaries to obtain travel visas. If you meet family to travel home, seek counsel and direction from your mission president in advance.

You may not complete your missionary service in another mission or request to be moved to another mission after your release date in order to be the companion of a relative.

When you return home, arrange with your home stake president to be released as soon as possible.

As soon as you can after returning home, get screened for tuberculosis, even if you were tested for it before your mission and do not have symptoms.

> 6.3

## Serving and Growing after Your Mission
When you return home, continue to live the gospel standards. Make sure to:

Pray and study the gospel daily.

Attend and participate in your home or young single adult ward.

Seek opportunities to serve in the temple if there is one nearby.

Attend institute or religious education classes.

Seek education and employment opportunities through Church and other resources.

Live so that you will experience the kind of joy described in the Book of Mormon when Alma the Younger met fellow missionaries later in life:

“And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.

“… Therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.

“But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God” (Alma 17:1–3; italics added).
